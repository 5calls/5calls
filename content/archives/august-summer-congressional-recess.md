This time is allotted for members of Congress to work in their districts and engage with constituents they represent. It is also the perfect time for them to hold public town halls and hear the concerns of their constituents live and in person. Given the [growing momentum behind an impeachment inquiry,](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/28/democrats-trump-impeachment-1438519) it’s more important than ever for you to make your voice heard. Call your local office and demand that your representative host a town hall and discuss their position on impeachment in light of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s July 24th House testimony. If your representative refuses to hold a town hall, demand an in-office meeting to explain their position.

Your congresspeople work for you, and you should have regular opportunities to discuss their positions, platforms, and how their legislative agendas will affect you and those close to you. Town halls are a critical tool for holding representatives accountable for their actions and ensuring that they hear the needs and concerns of their constituents in person.

**NOTE:** Call a local office number to get the most up-to-date town hall schedule information.
