On January 30, the Trump administration announced a [new initiative to allow states to set limits on federal funding](https://www.medicaid.gov/sites/default/files/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/smd20001.pdf) for Medicaid coverage for non-disabled adults. The federal government [currently covers a set percentage of states’ Medicaid costs](https://khn.org/news/block-grants-medicaid-faq/) regardless of total spending. Under the new Trump policy, states could apply for a waiver to receive a limited amount of federal Medicaid funding based on how many nondisabled adults they cover. States that adopt the funding cap [will be able to modify their Medicaid benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/medicaid-block-grant-trump.html) to cover fewer prescription drugs and eliminate traditional Medicaid benefits, including long-term care and non-emergency medical transportation. The policy would also let states charge [higher Medicaid copays](https://khn.org/news/5-things-to-know-about-trumps-medicaid-block-grant-plan/). 

[The proposed capped funding structure](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/30/800841612/trump-administration-offers-states-a-way-to-block-grant-medicaid) has the potential to [increase states’ administrative and cause Medicaid funding shortfalls](https://www.aafp.org/news/government-medicine/20200203medicaidblockgrant.html) during economic downturns. Healthcare advocates are concerned the plan could [reduce Medicaid patients’ access](https://medcitynews.com/2020/02/patient-groups-push-back-against-medicaid-block-grants/) to both clinical services and prescriptions]. Other critics have questioned whether the [Trump administration has legal authority to impose federal spending caps](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/480860-medicaid-block-grants-would-gut-law-and-cut-care) without congressional approval. 

[Research has shown](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-has-saved-at-least-19000-lives-new-research-finds) that Medicaid coverage saves lives and that [lack of drug coverage](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/27/799019013/when-insurance-wont-cover-drugs-americans-make-tough-choices-about-their-health) prevents people from taking necessary medications. Urge your representatives oppose the Trump administration's push to impose Medicaid funding caps.
