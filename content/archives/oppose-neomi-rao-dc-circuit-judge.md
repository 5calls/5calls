Neomi Rao, an anti-regulation attorney with no judicial experience, has been re-nominated to fill Brett Kavanaugh’s vacated DC Circuit Court of Appeals seat. This court reviews the legality of DC-based federal agencies’ decisions and policies. As the current director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Rao has eroded the [exact federal regulations](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brett-kavanaugh-neomi-rao-court-nominee-sexual-assault_us_5c58abebe4b00187b554355d) she’d review as a Circuit Court judge. Under Rao, OIRA blocked [new guidance on handling workplace sexual assault](http://src.bna.com/zxz) and approved a [rule change restricting the definition of sexual assault on college campuses](https://wamu.org/story/18/11/20/betsy-devos-proposed-campus-sexual-assault-rules-bolster-rights-of-accused/). OIRA approved [rolling back protections against racist housing discrimination](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/7/18167275/disparate-impact-civil-rights-trump-administration) and [terminating the Clean Power Plan](https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/electric-utility-generating-units-repealing-clean-power-plan-0). The office is also finalizing a policy allowing [healthcare providers to deny care to LGBTQ+ patients](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/when-the-religious-doctor-refuses-to-treat-you/551231/). Despite the conflict of interest between Rao’s current position and her potential judicial role, she has [not promised to recuse herself](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/neomi-rao-pressed-on-past-writings-on-date-rape-at-hearing-on-her-judicial-nomination/2019/02/05/156b4784-28b4-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9fbb12082df2) from cases involving agency rules that she reviewed at OIRA.

Rao has a long history of attacking human rights, from [her defense of the ableist practice of “dwarf-tossing”](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/neomi-rao-dwarf-tossing-kavanaugh-replacement/) to college writings that [blamed sexual assault survivors for being attacked and dismissed racial issues in America as a “hot, money-making issue”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/neomi-rao-nomination-college-writings-court-appeals). Her anti-regulatory views and troubling disregard for basic human dignity disqualify her from sitting on one of our nation’s most important courts.
