>**UPDATE (09/24/19):** The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved Eugene Scaliaâ€™s nomination in a 12-11 vote, clearing the way for the full Senate to vote.

Eugene Scalia is Trump's choice to replace disgraced Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta. Scalia has a [long record](https://www.eugenescalia.com/) of serving corporate interests and fighting against rules and settlements that protect workers. He fought regulations to prevent repetitive stress injuries and defended a casino owner accused of stealing tips from employees. Most recently, Scalia went against the Labor Department to remove a rule requiring workers' retirement accounts be run in their best interest.

Scalia's past behavior and positions show a lack of regard for victims of workplace discrimination, harassment, and danger. He [relentlessly questioned a sexual harassment victim, bringing her to tears](https://prospect.org/article/eugene-scalia-once-represented-big-bank-sexual-harassment-case-it-got-ugly) and prevented a [class-action discrimination suit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/economy/eugene-scalia-labor-lawsuits.html) from disabled workers against UPS.

The Secretary of Labor maintains a balance of fairness between employers and employees across the nation. With a track record of defending abusive employers and attacking employees, Eugene Scalia's appointment to this powerful position virtually guarantees an anti-worker perspective. Congress must reject his appointment as Secretary of Labor.
