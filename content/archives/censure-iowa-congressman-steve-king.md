Congressman Steve King (R-IA) is again making headlines for his racist and xenophobic beliefs. In a January 10th [New York Times interview]( https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/steve-king-trump-immigration-wall.html), King is quoted as asking, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” His commentary provoked an [immediate response]( https://thehill.com/homenews/house/424747-gop-lawmaker-steve-kings-embrace-of-racism-has-no-place-in-congress) from conservative commentators and lawmakers alike, such as Liz Cheney (AR-WY) tweeting “These comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse.”

This is not the first time King has made overtly racist remarks. In 2017, King posted a tweet stating, "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies." King [doubled down on this racist worldview]( https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/steve-king-baby-tweet-235993) in an interview, stating, "You cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else's babies. You've got to keep your birth rate up, and that you need to teach your children your values...I'm a champion for Western civilization," and that he would like to see an America "that is so homogenous that we look a lot the same." David Duke of the KKK along with other well-known white nationalists have praised King’s comments and rhetoric. 

King's colleagues in the House must take action and call for his formal censure in response to his openly white supremacist comments and views.
