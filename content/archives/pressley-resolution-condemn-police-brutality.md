In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and the hundreds of other lives cut short by police violence, Congresswomen Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Karen Bass (D-CA) and Barbara Lee (D-CA) have introduced a [resolution to condemn police brutality, racial profiling and the excessive use of force.](https://pressley.house.gov/media/press-releases/following-george-floyd-murder-reps-pressley-omar-bass-lee-introduce-house) In addition to condemning all acts of police brutality, the resolution calls for the adoption of reforms and policies at all levels of government to end these injustices. These reforms include:

- Improving oversight and independent investigations to hold individual officers and police departments accountable; 

- Supporting efforts to establish all-civilian review boards with the authority to investigate police misconduct to ensure community-level oversight, accountability, and disciplinary action of police officers;

- Adopting unbiased law enforcement policies at all levels of government that reduce the disparate impact of police brutality, racial profiling and use of force on Native American, Black, and Brown people and other historically marginalized communities; and

- Calling for the Department of Justice to reassert its authority to investigate individual instances of racial profiling, police brutality, and violence and to investigate and litigate against individual law enforcement officers and police departments that routinely violate civil rights.

Demand your members of Congress support the House Resolution Condemning Police Brutality. Congress must unilaterally oppose all acts of police brutality, racial profiling, and excessive use of force.
