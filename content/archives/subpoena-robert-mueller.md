>**UPDATE (6/25/19):** The House has [subpoenaed Robert Mueller](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-to-testify-to-congress-in-open-session-about-his-investigation/2019/06/25/dde8c95a-975b-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?utm_term=.47aaf72f0edf) to testify publicly on July 17th.

In the days and weeks after Robert Mueller submitted his final report on the findings of the Russian investigation, Attorney General William Barr has used his position of power to lead a campaign of misinformation to distort the report’s conclusions. Barr initially blocked the public release of the report; instead publishing a misleading 4-page memo that caused Mueller to object internally to the DOJ because it [_“did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance”_](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/30/robert-mueller-william-barr-report-1295269) of the Russia investigation and created [_“public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.”_](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/30/robert-mueller-william-barr-report-1295269)  A few short weeks later, Mueller finally held a press briefing to rebut Barr and the administration's narrative that the report cleared Trump from crimes, stating, [_“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”_](https://www.apnews.com/94323cfc164c4759ba6bf84ad2a46203)

It is clear that the Trump administration and AG Barr have waged a war against the information contained in Mueller’s report. The dense, 448 page document is filled with legal terms and complex information, [making reading difficult for the general public](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/politics/mueller-report-bestseller/index.html) while also making it easy for Trump and Barr to mischaracterize its contents. It is time to for Mueller to set the record straight and publicly testify to Congress about the findings of the investigation. Televised, open hearings with Muller will finally allow light to shine on the true nature of what he found in his probe.

With the [August recess](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/News_August_Recess.htm) approaching soon, Congress must act quickly to ensure Mueller testifies before their month-long break. Urge your representative support subpoenaing Robert Mueller to testify publicly during the month of July.
