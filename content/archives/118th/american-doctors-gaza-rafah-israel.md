>**UPDATE (05/18/24):**  [17 of the 20 medical professionals](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/17-20-us-doctors-stuck-gaza-depart-help-us-officials-source-says-rcna152866) have been evacuated from Gaza. [Two U.S. permanent residents and 11 non-American medical team members](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/18/adam-hamawy-gaza-doctor-evacuation/) were not offered evacuation, as only US citizens were granted exit. Dr. Adam Hamawy, a U.S. citizen and former U.S. Army combat surgeon, choose to stay in Gaza out of solidarity to his team. 

A group of American medical professionals, on a humanitarian mission in Gaza, are trapped due to Israel's latest Rafah attack. Approximately [20 American medical professionals](https://theintercept.com/2024/05/13/rafah-doctors-european-hospital-un-employee-killed/), including 15 doctors, are currently stranded at the European Hospital in Gaza. These dedicated individuals have been providing critical medical services under increasingly perilous conditions.

Reports from the World Health Organization indicate that the [primary border exit they intended to use has been closed by Israeli authorities](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/05/13/1251016228/rafah-gaza-american-medical-volunteers-hospital), leaving them unable to safely leave the area. The situation in Gaza is deteriorating rapidly, making it increasingly unsafe and unsustainable for them to continue their humanitarian efforts without significant risk to their own lives.

It is imperative that the United States takes swift action to ensure the safe return of these brave men and women. They have selflessly put their lives on the line to assist those in dire need, and it is now our duty to provide them with the support and assistance necessary to bring them home safely.

Demand your representatives urge the Israeli government to guarantee their safe passage, halt its offensive and establish a humanitarian aid corridor. We need assurance that American aid workers can carry out their work without fear of attack and have the ability to return home safely.
