Trump and his team are moving full speed ahead to enact his Day 1 campaign promise to conduct a mass deportation of 10+ million undocumented immigrants from the United States. He is [expected to name](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html) immigration hardliner Stephen Miller as his deputy chief of staff and Project 2025 co-author Thomas Homan as his “border czar.” Homan previously served as Trump’s acting director of ICE and oversaw the destructive separation of families at the border, a process enthusiastically advocated for by Miller.

The widespread expulsion of immigrants is not only cruel and emotionally costly to millions of families around the country, it will also have severe effects on the US economy. [“That’s because immigrants – including people who are in America illegally – support the job market, keep inflation in check and add to the federal coffers.”](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/business/deportation-immigration-trump-cost-americans/index.html). This mass deportation will therefore [exacerbate labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/10/trumps-mass-deportation-plan-immigrant-workers-and-economy.html) in the construction, agriculture, and tech industries, create crippling delays, increase consumer prices, and [disrupt our food chain](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/mass-deportations-food-chain-california).

Knowing how negatively impactful this mass deportation plan will be to all Americans, Maura Healy, the Democratic Governor of Massachusetts, vowed to [refuse any request from the Trump administration](https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/massachusetts-governor-vows-to-refuse-trump-deportation-requests-absolutely-not-maura-healey-presidential-election-kamala-immigration-southern-border) to help conduct deportations. [Other Democratic governors](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-governors-vow-protect-states-trump-policies-rcna179295) have made similar pledges to combat Trump’s harmful policies, and it is crucial that all state leaders step up to protect their residents. The Trump administration intends to carry out deportations using [local law enforcement agencies and the National Guard](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-deportation-plan-faces-rebellion-1981970), which means Governors have direct power to stop it. Demand that your Governor refuse to help carry out Trump’s inhumane and destructive mass deportation plan.
