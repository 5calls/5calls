>**UPDATE (04/17/24):** The Senate has [voted to dismiss](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/mayorkas-impeachment-senate-immigration-border/) the articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Mayorkas, ruling the articles of impeachment were unconstitutional.

>**UPDATE (02/13/24):** With a narrow 214-213 vote, the House has impeached DHS Secretary Mayorkas. The resolution now goes to the Senate, where they will decide how they would like to proceed. The Senate has the ability to hold a trial, or can simply vote to dismiss it altogether. Demand your Senators dismiss this politically motivated travesty of the impeachment process.  

>**UPDATE (02/06/24):** In a stunning loss for the GOP, the House failed to impeach DHS Secretary Mayorkas in a vote of 214-216. However, the GOP used a procedural mechanism that would allow them to revisit an impeachment vote at a later date.

In yet another attempt to make border security a 2024 campaign issue, House Republicans have [moved to impeach the Secretary of Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas](https://apnews.com/article/mayorkas-homeland-security-impeachment-congress-f369f4b6270e59cb7b7003bc9d7ce448). The articles of impeachment accuse Mayorkas of [“willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law” and a “breach in public trust”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/30/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-explained/). However, even [conservative legal scholars argue](https://thehill.com/homenews/4439854-house-gop-faces-pointed-conservative-criticism-on-mayorkas-impeachment/) that [there is no valid impeachment case](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/30/opinions/alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment-push-reyes/index.html) against Mayorkas. Despite the [lack any evidence](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-unveils-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-lack-evidence-rcna136174) of a high crime or misdemeanor, the House Committee on Homeland Security voted along party lines to proceed with the articles of impeachment. This is the first time a cabinet member has been impeached in [nearly 150 years](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/30/politics/impeaching-dhs-secretary-mayorkas-committee/index.html). 

Though Republicans claim to want action on the border, they have decided to [kill a bipartisan compromise bill](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/28/politics/chris-murphy-immigration-border-deal-cnntv/index.html) that would initiate new regulations on immigration. The Biden administration has also [given in to many of the GOP demands,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/28/politics/chris-murphy-immigration-border-deal-cnntv/index.html) but because Donald Trump has called upon the House GOP to deny [“handing Biden a win,”](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-border-deal-stupid-republicans-biden-win-1234949036/) the bill is expected to be [dead on arrival](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/speaker-johnson-warns-senates-bipartisan-border-deal-will-be-dead-on-arrival-in-house) in the House. Instead of working to resolve immigration issues, Republicans continue to engage in political theater and attempt to sell the American public on an unfounded belief that our border is [“open” and “dangerous”](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3857782-myth-vs-truth-dissecting-the-republican-narrative-about-the-border/). The impeachment of Mayorkas is yet another play on this narrative.

Demand your Representatives reject this political grandstanding and craven abuse of power.
