In the waning days of Democratic control of the Senate, there are [several](https://5calls.org/issue/biden-confirm-judicial-nominees/) [opportunities](https://5calls.org/issue/oppose-cabinet-recess-appointments/) to help prevent abuses to democracy from the incoming Trump administration. One such opportunity is to pass the Protect Reporters From Exploitative State Spying Act, or [the PRESS Act, S. 2074](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2074/all-actions), bipartisan legislation that would provide new and clear protections to journalists and their information sources. The legislation [passed unanimously in the House](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-cheers-house-passage-of-the-press-act) in January but has yet to be considered by the Senate. 

The bill  has [two main components](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/opinion/editorials/press-act-reporters-leaks-whistleblower.html). First, it would prohibit the government from coercing journalists into disclosing their sources of information except in rare cases such as to prevent imminent violence. And second, it would prevent the government from spying on journalists via their technology providers. The bill also effectively protects government whistleblowers since fear of retaliation would be sidelined.

Given Trump’s alarming rhetoric about press freedoms, calling journalists the ["enemy of the people”](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437610-trump-calls-press-the-enemy-of-the-people/) and promising to [revoke licenses from broadcasters](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/media/trump-strip-tv-station-licenses-punish-media/index.html) that cover him unfavorably, it is essential that the current Senate pass the PRESS Act now, while they still have a chance to protect press freedoms.
