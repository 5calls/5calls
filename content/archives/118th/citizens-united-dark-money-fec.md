The [Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained) Supreme Court ruling in 2010 granted corporations and special interest groups the same First Amendment rights as individuals and allowed them to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns. This has had a devastating impact on the integrity of American democracy. The ruling has led to a proliferation of ["dark money"](https://campaignlegal.org/update/what-dark-money) in politics, where the source of campaign funding is concealed and can't be traced, enabling a small group of wealthy individuals and special interest groups to exert an unprecedented level of influence over our elections and corrupt the political process, undermining the principle of political equality and the ability of average citizens to have their voices heard.

In order to overturn the harms of Citizens United and restore integrity and fairness to our political system, House Democrats have introduced [H.J.Res.13,](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/13) the Democracy For All Amendment. This constitutional amendment would [“overturn the legal precedents that have allowed unrestrained campaign spending and dark money to corrupt American democracy.”](https://schiff.house.gov/news/press-releases/schiff-phillips-jayapal-mcgovern-introduce-constitutional-amendment-to-rein-in-unrestricted-campaign-spending)

Specifically, the Democracy for All Amendment would:

- Make clear the Constitution does not restrict the ability of Congress or states to propose reasonable, viewpoint-neutral limitations on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections;

- Distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities, including by prohibiting the latter from spending unlimited amounts of money to influence elections;

- Allow states to enact public campaign financing systems, which can restrict the influence of corporate or private wealth; and

- Take further steps to protect the freedom of the press in the case of future campaign finance-related legislation.

Demand your representatives support the effort to end Citizens United, to protect our democracy and ensure that political power is held by the people, not a wealthy few.
