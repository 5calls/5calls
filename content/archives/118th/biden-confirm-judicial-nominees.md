As a result of the 2024 election, Democrats will not only lose control of the White House but also the Senate, meaning that Trump and Senate Republicans will regain total control over federal judicial appointments. During Trump’s first term, Republicans added [234 conservative-leaning federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices,](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/08/us/politics/senate-democrats-judges.html) to our federal court system.

It is imperative that the Senate act now to limit Trump’s ability to fill our judicial branch with more right-wing extremists who will continue to strip away our rights and democratic institutions.
