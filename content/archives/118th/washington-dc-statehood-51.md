Residents of Washington, D.C. pay federal taxes, but don't have Senators or a Representative to vote on issues affecting them. Local laws that voters support can be overruled by Congress without the protective rights of a state. D.C. has a larger population than both Vermont and Wyoming, but less say in our government than either. In 2016, [86% of Washington, D.C.](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Election-Statehood-Council-Seats-400275901.html) voted for statehood over the unjust status quo.

Given recent events, lawmakers should prioritize making the District of Columbia a state and ensure that every American has fair and equal representation in the federal government. Demand that your Members of Congress support  [H.R. 51](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/51) and [S. 51](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/51) to finally grant statehood to the District of Columbia.
