Since 2020 there has been a stark rise in the number of book bans with more than 4000 books banned in schools and public libraries all across America. These book bans disproportionately remove works about LGBTQ+ communities, people of color, and others who have been marginalized. Book bans to this effect are not only discriminatory â€“ they are a violation of students' First Amendment right to access information, and a quality education. Book bans do not protect children.

[The American Library Association says](https://www.ala.org/news/2024/03/american-library-association-reports-record-number-unique-book-titles): "...challenges of unique titles surged 65% in 2023 compared to 2022 numbers, reaching the highest level ever documented by ALA. [ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom] documented 4,240 unique book titles targeted for censorship, as well as 1,247 demands to censor library books, materials, and resources in 2023."

Anti-freedom-to-read legislation already exists in many states, including [Idaho](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/h0710/), [Utah](https://utahnewsdispatch.com/briefs/utah-governor-signs-book-ban-legislature/), and [Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/10/11/texas-library-book-bans/). You can track book banning legislation across all 50 states [here](https://www.everylibrary.org/billtracking).

Demand your state representatives protect our freedom to read from oppressive legislation that makes libraries and schools fiscally liable for challenges, restricts books, and prevents librarians and educators from doing the jobs they have been trained to do.
