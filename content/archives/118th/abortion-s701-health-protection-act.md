In June of 2022, the Supreme Court flouted 50 years of legal precedent and ruled to [overturn Roe v. Wade,](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/dobbs-mississippi-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade/index.html) the landmark decision protecting abortion access for pregnant people at the federal level. Since then, states across the country have moved to [restrict or outright ban abortion care.](https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/)

Codifying abortion access through federal legislation is one of our last options to protect pregnant people. The Womenâ€™s Health Protection Act [(S.701)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/701) creates legal protections for both abortion providers and abortion care patients at the federal level, filling in the void left by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. [The bill](https://reproductiverights.org/the-womens-health-protection-act-federal-legislation-to-protect-the-right-to-access-abortion-care/) safeguards access to abortion care nationwide by preventing restrictions such as six-week bans, mandatory delay periods, biased anti-choice abortion counseling, and medically unnecessary ultrasounds.

Nobody should face forced birth. The rights to privacy and bodily autonomy are fundamental in a free and fair society. Demand your Senators support and immediately pass S. 701.
