In recent months, there has been an unprecedented increase in legislation targeting transgender people, with a particular focus on banning support for trans youth and restrictions on gender-affirming medical care. Over the past two years, [state lawmakers introduced well over 300 bills targeting trans people, more than in any previous period. More than 85% of this legislation focuses on trans youth.](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/28/1138396067/transgender-youth-bills-trans-sports) These proposed laws are riding on [a surge of misinformation about the nature and outcomes of gender-affirming care](https://slate.com/technology/2023/03/trans-youth-health-care-debate-affirmative-new-york-times-jamie-reed.html) for youth, and make inaccurate assertions about how often transgender people regret transitioning (which is extremely rare) when the concern should be focused on [rising rates of distress, depression and suicide in youth prevented from transitioning](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23281683/trans-kids-transition-medicine-surgery). 

In addition to bills banning necessary medical care, legislation continues to be introduced that [restrict what can be taught in schools, and exclude trans people from participation in sports, as well as restricting their access to bathrooms](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/28/1138396067/transgender-youth-bills-trans-sports). 

Demand your state representatives protect our transgender community members from oppressive and anti-science laws by opposing any legislation that restricts their freedoms and human rights.
