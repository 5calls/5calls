>**UPDATE (01/09/23):** The GOP-led House has adopted a rules package that includes the gutting of the Office of Congressional Ethics. Demand your Congressperson strengthen congressional oversight and reinstate the OCE. 

After a [contentious battle](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/politics/mccarthy-speaker-fight-friday/index.html) for Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthyâ€™s first action in his new role is to pass a rules package on how the House will govern itself for the next two years. In this package, Republican House members have laid out rules that would [gut the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE),](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/01/mccarthys-day-one-plan-gut-the-office-of-congressional-ethics/) impairing its role as an independent ethics watchdog of our elected officials. The OCE was [created in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Congressional_Ethics) on the recommendation of a bipartisan task force to clean up corruption in Congress and since its founding has [referred 52 Democrats and 50 Republicans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/08/house-republicans-office-congressional-ethics/) to the Ethics Committee for investigation.  

The new proposed rules by House Republicans would hamstring the OCE from doing its job by enacting a hiring freeze of new staff while retroactively imposing term limits on its [bipartisan eight-member board,](https://oce.house.gov/about/board-and-staff) which would expel three of the four Democratic members. These changes would eviscerate the OCE, hobbling its ability to conduct the necessary oversight of our elected officials.

Demand your Representative vote against any rules package that includes changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics. All members of congress should want a House free of corruption.
