> **Update 8/1/2024** KOSA has passed the Senate by a vote of 91-3 and will be considered by the House.

Congress has again put forward legislation aimed at controlling what content children see online, known as the [Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act (KOSA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2073). Lawmakers claim it would prevent kids from seeing inappropriate content online, however [KOSA would instead weaponize legal speech online](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/08/congress-amended-kosa-its-still-censorship-bill), encouraging government censorship against social media companies and others who host content that they deem "dangerous to children" while providing wide berth for what danger that might actually include.

Being able to mask this agenda under the guise of "protecting children" is a well-worn path for conservative lawmakers, it seems inevitable that if KOSA passes this law would be abused by those who wish to silence speech that they disagree with.

Though KOSA was easily passed in the Senate, it's unclear how much support it has in the House making it more important than ever to call your House rep to demand they oppose it.
