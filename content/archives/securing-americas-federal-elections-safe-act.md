>**UPDATE (07/24/19):** During his testimony before Congress, former special counsel Robert Mueller [called Russian electoral meddling](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/robert-mueller-congressional-testimony-full-opening-statement-n1033391?cid=sm_npd_ms_fb_ma) "among the most serious" challenges to US democracy that he'd ever encountered and added, "[T]his deserves the attention of every American." The Senate must act immediately to pass the House-approved SAFE Act and safeguard our elections.  

>**UPDATE (06/27/29):** With a 225-184 vote, the House has passed the SAFE Act. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

Given the impact of election interference on tipping the 2016 election to Donald Trump, improving the security and accessibility of our elections before 2020 is a top priority. To this end, Representative Zoe Lofgren has recently introduced [H.R. 2722](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2722): the Securing America’s Federal Elections (SAFE) Act. 

This bill establishes requirements and funding for important updates to our elections process including [paper ballot requirements](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/21/election-security-bill-requiring-paper-ballots-adv/) and other cybersecurity safeguards, improving ballot design to minimize confusion and user errors, and improving accessibility for voters with disabilities, voters whose primary language is not English, and voters with literacy difficulties. The legislation also provides [$600 million in funding](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/449760-house-panel-advances-election-security-bill-requiring-paper-ballots) for the Election Assistance Commission to increase security standards.

Together, these requirements will support a more secure, more accessible election to enable a truly representative vote from the American electorate. Representatives need to hear from their constituents that improving our federal voting process is a top priority before the 2020 election.
