>**UPDATE (10/24/19):** In a 227 to 181 vote , the House has passed the SHIELD Act. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

The Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act, [HR 4617](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4617) introduced by Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), is intended to protect our elections from foreign interference and disinformation campaigns. 
The Mueller investigation detailed a [sweeping, coordinated effort by the Russian government](https://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/) to interfere in our election in 2016, and raised the alarm that they continue to spread disinformation on American social media platforms. Furthermore, investigators found that Trump and at least [17 of his campaign officials had more than 100 contacts]( https://time.com/5573768/mueller-report-trump-russian-contacts/) with Russians and Wikileaks. Now, with the revelation that [Trump attempted to force Ukraine to investigate a conspiracy theory to damage a political rival,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49800181) it has never been more clear we need legislation to protect our elections from foreign interference. 

The SHIELD Act would:

- Create a duty to report illicit offers of campaign assistance from foreign governments and their agents,

- Improve transparency of online political advertisements,

- Close loopholes that allow foreign nationals and foreign governments to spend in U.S. elections,

- Restrict the exchange of campaign information between candidates and foreign governments and their agents, and

- Prohibit deceptive practices about voting procedures

Demand your representative support the SHIELD Act to protect our elections in 2020 and beyond.
