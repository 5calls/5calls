On Thursday, January 2, President Trump personally ordered the assasination in Iraq of Iranian Qassem Soleimani, the long time leader of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, all without notice to Congress. Despite the President’s [statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-strike-live-updates/2020/01/03/3779f55c-2e33-11ea-bcb3-ac6482c4a92f_story.html) “We did not take action to start a war,” to [experts](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/iran-loses-qassem-soleimani-its-indispensable-man/604375/), this was an act of war and the Iranian government has vowed “severe revenge” for Soleimani’s killing.  

With the Iranian government promising retaliation for the assassination, 3,500 additional US troops are being [deployed](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-deploy-roughly-3500-troops-middle-east-amid/story?id=68052645) to the Middle East
while [New York and Los Angeles](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/03/iran-us-cities-boost-police-security-retaliation-soleimani-death/2804629001/) are stepping up security measures. 

Congress must ask for answers about how this decision was made, and demand the Trump administration determine ways to de-escalate this conflict to avoid a protracted conflict with Iran.
