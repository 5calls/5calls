The [Hyde Amendment](https://www.aclu.org/other/access-denied-origins-hyde-amendment-and-other-restrictions-public-funding-abortion) is a budget rule that prohibits federal funding for legal abortion procedures, put in place each year since the _Roe v. Wade_ decision. Impoverished Medicaid recipients, service members, and young people are the most dependent on federally-funded health services. As a result, these vulnerable groups have dangerously limited access to abortion.

For many years, abortion being legal but not provided by the government to those who need it was a compromise position, but now there are bills in the [House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1692) and [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/758) to repeal the Hyde Amendment. The EACH Woman Act will "ensure coverage for abortion care in public health insurance programs" and require the government employee's insurance to cover abortion.
