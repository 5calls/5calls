The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed after World War II as an alliance between the US and multiple Allied European countries against retaliatory attack by Germany or the Soviet Union, and has continued to serve as a deterrent to Russian aggression ever since. Perhaps not surprisingly given his Russian connections, Trump has been consistently critical of our country’s continued participation in NATO. He has [repeatedly threatened to unilaterally withdraw the US from NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html), which would weaken US influence in Europe while simultaneously empowering Russia.

In anticipation of this drastically harmful move, Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) has [introduced a bipartisan joint resolution](https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-colleagues-reintroduce-bipartisan-bill-to-prevent-any-president-from-leaving-nato) that requires either Senate approval or an approved act of Congress before the President may withdraw the US from NATO. Senators and Representatives need to hear from their constituents that our participation in NATO is critical to protecting the US’s position as a major world power, and we must ensure congressional oversight to any decisions about withdrawing from NATO.
