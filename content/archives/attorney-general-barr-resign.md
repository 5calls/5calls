On May 1st, media outlets obtained a [letter](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/05/01/letter.32719.pdf) from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to Attorney General Bill Barr criticizing how Barr’s public characterization of Mueller’s investigative report. Mueller noted that Barr’s report summary “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of his team’s findings and created “public confusion about critical aspects of the results of [his team’s] investigation”. The Mueller letter suggests that Barr deliberately misled the public about Mueller’s conclusions to shield Trump from scrutiny. 

The same day that Mueller’s letter was released, Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his role in overseeing Mueller’s Russia investigation. In the hearing, Barr [admitted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/01/barrs-conclusions-are-undercut-by-his-lack-familiarity-with-details-muellers-probe/?utm_term=.a9a05a5d8dc4) that he had not fully reviewed the evidence behind Mueller’s before publicly concluding that Trump’s team had not colluded with Russia or obstructed Mueller’s investigation. He also made statements that [allegedly contradicted](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/02/nancy-pelosi-william-barr-lied-to-congress-1298314) his earlier testimony to the House Appropriations Committee and [argued](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1123670102535176192?s=19) that the president should be able to terminate any investigation if he felt he had been falsely accused. 

Mueller’s letter, combined with Barr’s apparent lies and other troubling conduct during his May 1st Senate Judiciary hearing, revealed that Barr is utterly unfit to lead the Department of Justice. Congress must urge Barr to resign.
