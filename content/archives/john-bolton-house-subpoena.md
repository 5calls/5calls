On Friday, January 31st, the Senate voted on whether to bring witnesses forward during the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. With only 2 Republican Senators agreeing with Democrats that witness are required to hold a fair and just trial, [the motion to call witness failed 49-51.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-impeachment-trial-senators-vote-on-witnesses-11580508468) This blockade of witness testimony by the GOP only serves to demonstrate the party’s full complicity in allowing Donald Trump to [commit crimes while serving as President.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/16/gao-severely-rebukes-trumps-ukraine-ploy-undermines-his-no-crime-defense/) With [two-thirds of Americans agreeing](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/66-call-witnesses-trumps-impeachment-trial-poll/story?id=68509143) that witness should be called, it now becomes the duty of the House to fulfill the responsibility the Senate would not take on.

One key witness with direct knowledge of Trump’s abuse of power is former National Security Advisor John Bolton. On January 26th, the [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/trump-bolton-book-ukraine.html) on Bolton’s unreleased book manuscript where he claims Trump informed him the release of Ukrainian aid was directly tied to an investigation into the Bidens. Furthermore, he claims Trump [directed him to assist in pressuring](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/us/politics/trump-bolton-ukraine.html) the Ukrainian government to announce a Biden investigation. While originally unwilling to testify, [Bolton recently stated](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/us/politics/bolton-testify-impeachment-trial.html) he was now willing to tell his story if he was called forward. 

Bolton’s credible allegations must be heard publicly and under oath. The House must now continue with what the Senate was unwilling to do: give the American public a full account of Trump’s criminal behavior and abuse of power for his own personal benefit.
