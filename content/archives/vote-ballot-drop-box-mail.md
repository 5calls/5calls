Given the uncertainty of COVID-19 and how it may endanger in-person voting for the 2020 General Election, vote-by-mail (absentee ballot) options will be critical for many Americans to vote safely. Nearly all states are now allowing vote-by-mail for this election. However, the success of vote-by-mail still depends on the ability of the USPS to pick up and deliver absentee ballots to be counted before the deadline. The Trump administration has [recently escalated its efforts to undermine the USPS](https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-just-made-sweeping-changes-to-the-nations-mail-service-2020-8), leading to widespread concerns about the ability of the USPS to handle the anticipated surge in vote-by-mail this November. 

One straightforward and cost-effective solution is to set up secure ballot drop boxes where voters can deposit their completed absentee ballot without relying on USPS or having to risk in-person voting. Given the Trump administrationâ€™s obvious attempts to suppress vote-by-mail, state and local governments must start preparing now to ensure voters have safe and reliable methods to deliver their absentee ballot. 

Demand your state leadership create a secure ballot drop box program so that the Trump administration's interference with the USPS does not impact the safety, accessibility, and accuracy of the November election.
