After the White House [refused to meet a legally mandated assessment](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/02/08/politics/white-house-khashoggi-deadline/index.html?__twitter_impression=true) of who they believe is responsible for murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a bipartisan group of Senators [reintroduced a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/398) to suspend weapons sales and impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia related to its activities in the Yemen civil war. Khashoggi’s murder is widely believed to been ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the second in charge and effective ruler of Saudi Arabia. The White House’s refusal to comply with the Feb. 8, 2019 deadline is another tactic employed by the administration to ignore overwhelming evidence that the murder of an American legal resident was ordered by the de facto Saudi Arabian leader. Taken together with a [recent report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-trump-appointees-promoted-selling-nuclear-power-plants-to-saudi-arabia-over-objections-from-national-security-officials-house-democratic-report-says/2019/02/19/6a719762-3456-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.3f149358286b) that White House operatives pushed to give the Saudis access to nuclear technology that could be turned into weapons signals the Trump Administration will continue to ignore the nation’s foreign policy role in favor of profiteering.

S. 398, the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2019, will impose new limits on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose sanctions on individuals involved in Khashoggi’s death. Urge your senators to block any future Saudi-US weapons deals and to send a clear signal that Khashoggi’s death will not go unaddressed.

- Is your Senator a [cosponsor]( https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/398/cosponsors) of this legislation?
