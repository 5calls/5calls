Amid reports that the novel coronavirus has infected [nearly 10 million people in the United States](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html), the Supreme Court [began hearings](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/california-v-texas/) on a case to overturn the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Republican-led states brought the suit against the ACA with Trump administration support, while Democrat-led states are opposing the suit. [Republican plaintiffs argue](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/11/case-preview-justices-will-consider-constitutionality-of-acas-individual-mandate-again/) that because Republicans [zeroed out the financial penalty for not buying insurance](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20171220.323429/full/), the ACA’s individual insurance mandate is unconstitutional, and the whole law should be overturned.  

The ACA has [survived two previous Supreme Court challenges](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/10/932441334/will-supreme-court-invalidate-obamacare-a-decade-after-it-was-enacted). However, Republicans’ [unprecedentedly hasty confirmation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/politics/senate-confirms-barrett.html) of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett poses a new risk to the law. Legal analysts [have predicted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/08/affordable-care-act-new-challenge-uphill-battle-supreme-court/6125894002/) that the case against the ACA is too “far-fetched” to convince even the conservative Court to eliminate the law completely. However, with [millions of people’s healthcare access at risk](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-if-the-supreme-court-overturns-obamacare/), the stakes are simply too high to count on the Supreme Court. 

Fortunately, a [simple legislative fix](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/us/obamacare-aca-supreme-court.html) could render the entire case moot. Congress could invalidate plaintiffs’ argument by reinstating a financial penalty (even a penalty as small as $1) for not having insurance or by repealing the individual mandate itself. Congress must act immediately to defend the ACA.
