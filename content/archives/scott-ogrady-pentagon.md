Trump has [nominated](https://www.congress.gov/nomination/116th-congress/2363?s=1&r=25) Scott O’Grady to take a position as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at the Pentagon. A former Air Force captain who survived being [shot down by Serbian jets](https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/16/us/scott-ogrady-rewind/index.html) over Bosnia, O’Grady came home a bonafide hero in the 1990s and subsequently pursued a career in commercial real estate and motivational speaking, even obtaining a degree in theology. In recent years however, he has set aside his previous achievements, choosing instead to [spout and amplify multiple false claims and conspiracy theories favorable to Trump’s delusional narratives](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/04/politics/trump-nominee-pentagon-martial-law/index.html) on Twitter, calling for martial law and a new election, and dismissing President-Elect Joe Biden’s electoral win as fraudulent.

Confirming O’Grady, even for a short tenure, would elevate and validate anti-democratic conspiracy theories popular with the [QAnon political movement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-qanon-what-we-know-about-the-conspiracy-theory-11597694801) and could possibly lead to a further breakdown in federal government institutions. Given his penchant for outrageous conspiracy theories, it would be dangerous to give O’Grady control of any military function, even if this particular role is primarily focused on setting policy abroad. Scott O’Grady must not be confirmed by the Senate.
