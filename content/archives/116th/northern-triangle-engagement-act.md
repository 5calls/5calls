On May 9th, Representatives Eliot Engel (D-NY), Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Michael McCaul (R-TX), the Committee’s Ranking Member, introduced HR 2615, the [United States–Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act]( https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2615
), which supports the people of Central America and strengthens U.S. national security by addressing the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

The legislation authorizes irrevocable foreign assistance to Central America for fiscal year 2020 and reasserts congressional intent by not permitting authorized funds to be reprogrammed, transferred or rescinded. The bill also lays out a series of actions to be taken by the Secretary of State, the Administrator of USAID and other U.S. government officials to promote inclusive economic growth and development, combat corruption, strengthen democratic institutions and improve security conditions in the Northern Triangle.

Specifically, the United States – Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act would:

- Authorize $577 million in foreign assistance to Central America to address the root causes of migration in fiscal year 2020. It includes conditions on any assistance going to the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras
- Requires the Department of State and USAID to develop and report to Congress on annual benchmarks to track the progress of the strategy in addressing the drivers of irregular migration
- Requires the Secretary of State and USAID Administrator to prioritize inclusive economic growth and development, anti-corruption, and strengthening democratic institutions and security conditions in the Northern Triangle
- Puts in place targeted visa bans and asset freezes on individuals who are determined to be engaged in acts of corruption impacting the Northern Triangle countries
- Enhances engagement with the Mexican government on the Northern Triangle
- Requires advance notification to Congress on security assistance to Northern Triangle countries, regardless of the dollar amount for the following three years
