During a mass shooting, the time it takes for a shooter to reload a weapon can provide critical time for victims to flee and law enforcement to intervene. Large capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition significantly increase a shooterâ€™s ability to injure and kill large numbers of people quickly without stopping to reload. The perpetrators of [recent high-profile mass shootings](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/08/05/el-paso-dayton-shooting-guns-legal-rifles-high-capacity/1922290001/) in Dayton, OH; El Paso, TX; and Gilroy, CA all used large capacity magazines. 

Previous legislation banning large capacity magazines expired in 2004. Since that time, the number of shootings involving this deadly weapon enhancement has [greatly increased](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/as-mass-shootings-rise-experts-say-high-capacity-magazines-should-be-the-focus/2019/08/18/d016fa66-bfa3-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html). The Keep Americans Safe Act, [H.R. 1186](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1186), would prohibit the import, sale, manufacture, transfer or possession of high-capacity magazines (i.e. magazines accepting more than 10 rounds of ammunition) for civilian use. The bill would also mandate that high-capacity magazines manufactured for law enforcement use be clearly marked with a serial number, a requirement that already exists for law enforcement-designated weapons. 

Americans must not accept mass shootings as a normal part of daily life. Lawmakers should immediately pass common sense gun legislation like the Keep Americans Safe Act.
