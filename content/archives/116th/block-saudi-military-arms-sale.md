>**UPDATE (07/29/19):** In a 45-40 vote, the Senate failed to overturn Trump's veto of the Saudi weapons deal. 

>**UPDATE (07/28/19):** After Trump [vetoed the resolutions](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/25/745200244/trump-vetoes-bills-intended-to-block-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia) to block the Saudi arms deal, the Senate is scheduled to vote on a veto override on Monday, July 29th.

>**UPDATE (07/17/19):** The House has voted to block Trump's weapons deal to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The resolutions now heads to Trump's desk where he is expected to issue a veto. 

>**UPDATE (06/20/19):** In a 51-45 vote, the Senate has taken the first step to block the arms deal. The resolutions of disapproval now move to the House for consideration. 

On May 24th, the Trump administration [declared another national emergency](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-arms/defying-congress-trump-sets-8-billion-plus-in-weapons-sales-to-saudi-arabia-uae-idUSKCN1SU25R) to get around congressional approval, this time to sell Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates roughly $8 billion in military arms. Without providing any evidence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued an [_“emergency exists, which requires the immediate sale of the defense articles and defense services."_](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/politics/trump-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-uae/index.html) The 22 individual sales would include precision-guided bombs, Patriot missiles, mortar rounds, drones, fighter jet parts and other military support.

However, Congress can use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to block the administration from completing the deal. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has introduced [22 resolutions of disapproval](https://www.rollcall.com/news/bipartisan-senate-group-seek-block-saudi-arms-sales-trump-administration-tries-avoid-congressional-review) (one for each sale) which would terminate the arms deal. Due to Senate rules, only a simple majority is needed to pass the resolutions of disapproval.

It is time for Congress stand up and object to Trump’s clear abuse of power. He must not be allowed act unilaterally and again sidestep normal congressional review. Demand your member of Congress support the resolutions of disapproval.
