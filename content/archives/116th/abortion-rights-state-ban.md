A number of states have recently passed the most draconian abortion limitations in recent history. Many of these laws are so-called fetal heartbeat bills that ban abortion at around six weeks, before many people [even realize they’re pregnant](https://americanpregnancy.org/week-by-week/4-weeks-pregnant/). [Some laws](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/alabama-georgia-abortion-bills/589504/) impose felony charges for obtaining abortions, grant states the power to prosecute people over miscarriages, and deny people the right to abortion even in cases of rape or incest. All of these bills are an [assault on pregnant people’s fundamental right to bodily autonomy](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/AbortionPoliciesReproductiveHealth.pdf). 

Thanks to the [Republican Party’s obstruction](https://www.rollcall.com/news/trumps-federal-judge-pace-matches-recent-presidents-big-twist) of President Obama’s judicial nominations, the Trump administration has appointed dozens of anti-choice judges at every level of the federal court system, including new Supreme Court appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Anti-choice legislatures know that their new abortion restrictions are likely to be appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court, where the conservative majority will have a [chance to erode or even entirely reverse](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/15/18623073/roe-wade-abortion-georgia-alabama-supreme-court) the historic Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. 

Limiting and criminalizing abortion will [worsen the US’s already abysmal maternal health outcomes](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2018/06/13/451891/limiting-abortion-access-contributes-poor-maternal-health-outcomes/) and [disproportionately harm](https://rewire.news/article/2019/02/06/restrictions-on-later-abortions-hurt-people-of-color-the-most/) pregnant people who are low income and/or people of color. Urge your state legislators to commit to defending abortion access today.
