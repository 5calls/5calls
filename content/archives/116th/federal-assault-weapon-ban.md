In 2004, the NRA successfully pressured the Republican-controlled government into not renewing the [1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/13/clinton-signs-assault-weapons-ban-sept-13-1994-813552) The ban had been working to protect lives; after it expired the number of gun massacre deaths (which had decreased over 40% during the ban) jumped nearly 2.5 fold. 

Gun violence experts are now renewing their calls for a nationwide ban on these types of weapons - and Americans agree - [recent polls show](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-control-poll-americans-support-assault-weapons-ban-after-florida-shooting-2018-2) at least two-thirds of Americans support a nationwide assault weapons ban. 

To reinstate an assault weapons ban, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has introduced [S. 66](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/66) and Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) has introduced [H.R. 1296](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1296), both titled the Assault Weapons Ban of 2019. These bills would ban future sales of high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons, including the AR-15 used in many recent gun massacres. Legislators must act now before any more lives are needlessly lost.
