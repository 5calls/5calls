On Thursday February 8, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey introduced the [Green New Deal resolution](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/7/18211709/green-new-deal-resolution-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-markey), which outlines a broad program to address the accelerating twin crises of climate change and economic disparity in our country, with a focus on justice for those frontline communities most impacted by both. For instance, in addition to the environmentally-focused requirement for net zero greenhouse gas emissions and infrastructure investment, the program also includes a federal jobs guarantee, the right to unionize, and universal housing and healthcare. 

Although unlikely to be taken up in the Republican-majority Senate, if House Democrats can pass this progressive resolution then it will be a key focus for the 2020 elections. If the election results in a Democratic Congress and President, this momentum will rapidly carry the Green New Deal into law. 

Tell your Representatives and Senators that supporting the Green New Deal is critical to ensure both environmental and economic security for all Americans.
