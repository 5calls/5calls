- $8.6 billion for Trump’s southern border wall, which even former [Chief of Staff John Kelly calls a “waste of money”](http://fortune.com/2019/03/07/john-kelly-border-wall-waste-of-money/)

An administration’s budget is a reflection of the party’s priorities and goals for the nation. It is clear from the Trump budget proposal that the Republicans main concern is cutting social and domestic programs in order to pay for massive for tax breaks given to millionaires and corporations, all while increasing the national deficit for future generations. Constituents must make it clear to Congress that Trump's budget strays far from true American values and must not be taken seriously.
