The Senate and House of Representatives are in congressional recess from February 17th-23rd. This time is allotted for members of Congress to work in their districts and engage with constituents they represent. It is also the perfect time for them to hold public town halls and hear the concerns of their constituents live and in person. 

Your representatives work for you: you should have regular opportunities to discuss their positions, platforms, and how their legislative agendas will affect you and those close to you. Town halls are a critical tool for holding representatives accountable for their actions and ensuring that these men and women, who spend much of their time outside of their home states, are hearing the needs and concerns of their constituents in person.

Take the opportunity during this recess period to speak to your members of Congress. Attend a scheduled town hall, or if your congressional members refuse to hold a town hall, request an in-office meeting to discuss your concerns.

**NOTE:** Select a local office number to get the most up-to-date town hall schedule information.
