**UPDATE (01/30/19):** After facing backlash from the public, House Republicans [finally named their membership to the House Intelligence Committee](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/30/john-ratcliffe-house-intelligence-1130751) on January 30th. 

Weeks after the beginning of the 116th Congress, [Republican membership to the powerful House Intelligence Committee have yet to be named](https://www.axios.com/republicans-stall-house-intelligence-committee--f6863414-103d-496b-a784-33f8a32d4d25.html). House Democrats announced their intel committee membership on January 16th, however the GOP has remained silent even though they have named membership to all 23 other House committees.

By delaying the staffing of the House Intel Committee, the panel cannot perform any work, including holding hearings, issuing subpoenas, and importantly, providing witness transcripts to Mueller’s team. Incoming committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) has signaled sending material to Muller would be “the first order of business” because [“we believe other witnesses were untruthful before our committee.”](https://www.thedailybeast.com/adam-schiff-send-team-trump-transcripts-to-mueller-now) 

[Transcripts of Roger Stone’s House Intel meetings](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/422280-house-intel-votes-to-release-roger-stone-transcript-to-mueller) were provided to Mueller’s team on December 20th of 2018, which lead to his indictment in January. Others such as Eric Prince and Donald Trump Jr. are suspected to lying to Congress. The GOP must immediately announce their Intel Committee membership and stop delaying critical investigations.
