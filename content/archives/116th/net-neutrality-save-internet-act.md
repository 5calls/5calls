>**UPDATE (04/10/19):** The House has passed H.R. 1644 in a 232-190 vote. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

In December of 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 along party lines to reverse the 2015 Open Internet Order regulation established to protect net neutrality. Net neutrality lets all users have equal access to all internet content and prevents internet service providers (ISPs) from discriminating against content, such as charging extra for high-speed access to specific websites or blocking access to certain sites altogether. While large media and telecom companies such as Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T cheered the regulation reversal, tech companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and Facebook strongly opposed rollback. 

In order to restore the 2015 Open Internet Order, both [House and Senate Democrats have introduced legislation](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/democrats-unveil-save-internet-act-restore-net-neutrality-laws-n980051) to undo the 2017 regulation reversal. The Save the Internet Act of 2019, a [simple three-page bill](https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1103331524374605825), would return to the protections of the 2015 Open Internet Order, ensuring an open internet for everyone.

Eighty three percent of the US public, including 3 out of 4 Republicans, [opposed the regulation change in 2017.]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?utm_term=.b66263cd8976) With that level of public support, members on both sides of the aisle should work together to pass the Save the Internet Act immediately.
