Despite a total refusal to allow White House advisors to testify before Congress, Stephen Miller’s dominating role in the nation’s appalling border security and immigration policies are shaping up to be reason to rethink the status quo. Although the White House claims that advisors like Miller are shielded from Congressional oversight by executive privilege, his list of accomplishments is troubling, and continues to grow:

- Yet another child has [died](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/16-year-old-unaccompanied-migrant-boy-dies-while-u-s-n1000821) in ICE custody 
- Health and Human Services officials admit that they have no viable way to [reunite](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/emails-show-trump-admin-had-no-way-link-separated-migrant-n1000746) the vast majority of families separated at the border
- Miller [toyed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-take-aim-at-miller-as-questions-persist-about-sanctuary-city-targeting/2019/04/14/61824ef4-5ed5-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html?utm_term=.a2dd61a02d38) with a policy of targeted release, a plan to release undocumented migrants into cities within democratic districts as political retribution, widely reported to be championed by Miller alone.
- Other policies he has advanced include offering families in border detention a [“binary choice”](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/trump-family-separation-binary-choice-1266675) to either remain in detention or surrender their children, [zero-tolerance](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/politics/family-separation-trump.html) regarding asylum claims, declaration of a [national emergency](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html) at the border, a 2017 executive order [barring travelers from seven muslim-majority nations](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/15/stephen-miller-new-trump-travel-ban), and suspension of many asylum admissions programs. 

Miller, who formerly served as a congressional aide to Jeff Sessions, appears to be a singular and highly influential actor in determining immigration policy regardless of the supposed input of the DHS Secretary and legal advisors. Miller should face accountability for his policies and appear before Congress to answer questions about his role as the [mastermind](https://www.newsweek.com/will-stephen-miller-testify-congress-controversial-white-house-immigration-1396106) of these policies.  

Congress should reconsider its recent decision to drop plans to subpoena Miller. Tell your lawmaker to call for Miller’s testimony before Congress.
