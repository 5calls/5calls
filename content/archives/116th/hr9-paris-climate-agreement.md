>**UPDATE (05/02/19):** The House has passed H.R. 9 in a 231-190 vote. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

n July 2017, Trump announced his plan to [formally withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html) in 2020. The international agreement aims to limit global warming this century to 2 degrees Celsius and has been signed by [174 countries and the European Union](https://unfccc.int/news/175-states-sign-paris-agreement). Under the Obama administration, the U.S. committed to reducing emissions to 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025. Although the Paris Agreement is non-binding, it is a milestone for international cooperation and leadership to combat the dire threat of climate change. 

With [seven in ten Americans supportive of the US remaining](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/paris_agreement_by_state/) in the Paris Agreement, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL) has introduced [H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/436088-pelosi-dems-unveil-bill-to-bind-trump-to-paris-climate-accord). The bill [would require the US to remain in the Paris Agreement](https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-joins-chair-castor-introducing-climate-action-now-act) and require the president to develop a plan to achieve Agreement benchmarks. It would also prohibit the use of federal funds to advance US withdrawal from the agreement. 

Our nation cannot afford to continue protecting polluters in the face of [increasingly extreme weather and rising sea levels](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-climate-change-report-2018-united-nations-extreme-weather-global-warming-today-2019-03-28/). We must show our commitment to international solutions to a global problem by remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement. Call your reps today and urge they support H.R. 9.
