>**UPDATE (3/27/19):** In a 248-181 vote, the [House failed to get the 2/3rds majority required to override Trump’s veto.](https://www.axios.com/trump-national-emergency-house-veto-overrride-fails-108c1418-78e0-4d8d-9e4a-4c3c9dfb9fd2.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=1100) Trump may now proceed to redirect funds intended for our military to build his wall.

>**UPDATE (3/16/19):** Even though both the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed H.J. Res. 46, Trump has vetoed the legislation. The House is scheduled to hold a veto override vote on Tuesday, March 26, which will require a 2/3rds majority to pass. 

>**UPDATE (03/14/19):** The Senate has passed H.J. Res. 46 by a 59-41 vote with GOP Senators Alexander, Blunt, Collins, Lee, Moran, Murkowski, Paul, Portman, Romney, Rubio, Toomey, and  Wicker voting with Democrats. 

>**UPDATE (02/26/19):** On Tuesday, February 26th, the [House passed a resolution of disapproval](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-sponsor-of-resolution-to-nix-emergency-declaration-acknowledges-uphill-battle-on-overriding-expected-trump-veto/2019/02/26/22104532-39d2-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html?utm_term=.ad7d16761e88) (H.J. Res. 46) which is the first step in terminating Trump’s national emergency order. 

On Friday February 15th, Donald Trump brazenly [declared a state of emergency](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/15/trump-national-emergency-border-wall-1170988) on the US southern border and subsequently redirected over $6.6B to construct 234 miles of barriers. The diversion of funds comes from money appropriated by Congress for the military: $3.6B from a military construction fund, $2.5B from a Pentagon drug prevention program, and $600M from a Treasury Department drug forfeiture fund. 

Appropriation of funds by the US House of Representatives is one of the most important roles performed of the chamber. By declaring a national emergency, Trump is [abusing his power](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/dangerous-abuse-lawless-bipartisan-attack-trump-national-emergency-declaration-n971826) as the President to bypass Congress to fund his pet project.  After the [longest government shutdown in US history](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-the-longest-government-shutdown-every-government-shutdown-and-how-long-they-lasted/) and weeks of negotiation, Congress struck a bipartisan deal on February 11th that included $1.375B for Trump’s wall, a far cry from the $5.7B he demanded. Backed into a corner, Trump has declared the emergency to appease his base, ignoring the dubious constitutional standing or the harm diverting funds might incur. 

It is now time for Congress to act regardless of party affiliation. This power grab by Trump is inexcusable and must be met with sharp resistance and repercussion.
