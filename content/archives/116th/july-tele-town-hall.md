title: "Request a July Recess Tele-Town Hall to Discuss the COVID-19 Outbreak"

session: 116

>**UPDATE (07/06/20):** Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we should encourage our Senators to hold tele-town halls to replace in-person meetings. Ask your Senator to hold a digital meeting to discuss the COVID outbreak and the next steps our communities can take.

The US Senate is in recess from July 6th-20th. This time is allotted for members of Congress to work in their districts and engage with constituents they represent. It is also the perfect time for them to hold public town halls and hear the concerns of their constituents live and in person. 

Your Senators works for you: you should have regular opportunities to discuss their positions, platforms, and how their legislative agendas will affect you and those close to you. Town halls are a critical tool for holding elected officials accountable for their actions and ensuring that these men and women, who spend much of their time outside of their home states, are hearing the needs and concerns of their constituents in person.

Take the opportunity during this recess period to speak to your Senator. Attend a scheduled town hall, or if your Senator refuses to hold a town hall, request a meeting to discuss your concerns.

**NOTE:** Select a local office number to get the most up-to-date town hall schedule information.
