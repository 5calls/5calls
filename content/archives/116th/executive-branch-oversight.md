The Trump Administration has an ongoing and alarming pattern of completely ignoring the checks and balances of Congress, setting the stage for a constitutional crisis. For example:

- They are refusing to comply with [subpoenas related to the Mueller investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-is-opposed-to-white-house-aides-testifying-to-congress-deepening-power-struggle-with-hill/2019/04/23/0c7bd8dc-65e0-11e9-8985-4cf30147bdca_story.html?utm_term=.fca582f8dadb)

- White House staffer Steven Miller, President Trump’s controversial immigration advisor, [has refused to appear before Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/trump-wont-make-immigration-adviser-available-to-congress/2019/04/25/51f1a5f0-679c-11e9-a698-2a8f808c9cfb_story.html?utm_term=.8dbf442ef8cb)  

Congress has a constitutional right and a duty to check the power of the executive with oversight. Tell your representative that honoring the will of the people and valuing the  Constitution are the priority.
