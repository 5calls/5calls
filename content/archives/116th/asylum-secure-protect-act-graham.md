In May, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced S.1494 “The Secure and Protect Act of 2019” which aims to [modify our current asylum process, making it more difficult and risky for applicants] (https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/politics/graham-immigration-bill/index.html). His bill changes the current system in three key ways: it requires application for asylum be filed not at the border but in the applicant’s home country, it allows for migrant children to be held in custody for 100 days rather than 20, and it makes it easier to deport unaccompanied minors. These changes would disproportionately impact the most vulnerable migrants - those at high risk of retaliation from their own governments, as well as children - making this a transparent attempt at punishing migrants seeking lawful asylum.

On Thursday August 1, Graham [overrode Democrat objections and waived committee rules](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/455748-graham-moves-controversial-asylum-bill-through-panel-democrats-charge-hes)
in order to forcibly advance the bill through the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senators need to hear from their constituents that this bill should be soundly rejected. It does nothing to help our country but instead punishes the most vulnerable migrants. Graham must not be rewarded for breaking the rules in forcing his bill towards a Senate vote.
