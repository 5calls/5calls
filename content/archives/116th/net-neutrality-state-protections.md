>**UPDATE (10/1/19):** Although a federal appeals court [upheld the main thrust of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) repeal of net neutrality rules,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/01/appeals-court-upholds-trump-administrations-cancelling-net-neutrality-rules/) that opinion also struck down efforts to prevent state governments from enacting their own net neutrality laws and regulations, saying it amounted to an attempt to "categorically abolish all fifty States' ... authority to regulate intrastate communications." Demand your state legislators take action immediately to protect your rights for a fair and open internet.

The repeal of net neutrality rules that required all internet traffic to be treated equally means that internet service providers (ISPs) now can slow down or charge more for access to certain websites. However, with Tuesday's federal appeals court decision to overturn the FCC order banning states from explicitly establishing their own net neutrality laws, there are still steps that your state can take to protect the freedom of information that is essential to our democracy. 

States can provide incentives to ISPs that are net neutral and encourage competition in the broadband market. They can also withhold state benefits from, refuse to do business with, or even (depending on the state) block access to utility poles for ISPs that are not net neutral. Urge your state representatives to propose and support legislation designed to maintain net neutrality in your home state.
