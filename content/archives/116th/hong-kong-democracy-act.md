>**UPDATE (10/15/19):** The House has passed HR 3289. It is now up to the Senate to act on the legislation. 

The citizens of Hong Kong have held strong in their [months-long protests, rallies, and marches]( https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695) to fight the erosion of political freedoms in the territory. One of their requests is for US lawmakers to pass the bipartisan [Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act] (https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/09/article/hk-protesters-call-on-us-to-pass-human-rights-act/) (HR 3289/S 1838), which would require the US to perform annual assessments on the autonomy of region. 

The legislation would require the US to:

- assess if Hong Kong is continuing to be sufficiently autonomous to receive ‘special status’ which gives the city preferential trade and economic treatment, shielding it from Trump’s trade war,

- freeze the assets of any official found to be suppressing the basic freedoms of Hong Kong citizens, and 

- assess if Hong Kong is continuing to enforce US and UN sanctions and export regulations

American lawmakers must show their solidarity with the citizens of Hong Kong. Call your legislators today and demand they support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
