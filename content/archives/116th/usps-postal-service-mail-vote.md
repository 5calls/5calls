In May, the Trump-appointed "Postal Board of Governors" [selected Louis DeJoy as the Postmaster General of the US Postal Service](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html). DeJoy has been a significant Republican fundraiser, has no Postal Service experience, and holds investments in competitors to the USPS. 

Beginning his tenure in June, he immediately took steps to fulfill his pledge to make the agency more efficient and solvent, which has resulted in slower and unpredictable mail service and [uncounted ballots in recent primary elections](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness).  Then, on August 7, DeJoy announced a [plan to restructure the  service](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/07/postal-service-investigation-dejoy/) including reassigning 23 postal executives, further raising concerns about the ability of the agency to handle mailed ballots in the upcoming general election.

Demand your lawmakers  launch an investigation into the actions of the Postmaster General to discover if there are financial and/or political motivations behind the recent staff changes.
