A year after his confirmation to the Supreme Court, details of yet another sexual assault committed by Brett Kavanaugh has been brought to light. Journalists from the New York Times [uncovered the new story](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/sunday-review/brett-kavanaugh-deborah-ramirez-yale.html) while also discovering new corroborating details for the story brought forth in 2018 by Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh’s Yale classmate. The new allegation comes from another Yale classmate, Max Stier, who says that Kavanaugh forced his penis into a woman’s hand at a different party, behavior that strongly resembles previous descriptions by Ramirez and Christine Blasey Ford. The New York Times also reported that after the FBI was ordered to conduct an investigation prior to Kavanaugh's final confirmation, they did not look into Stier’s claim nor follow up with the 25 witnesses named by Ramirez.

It was already clear when the FBI investigation was first ordered that the [White House sought to limit their scope](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/white-house-limits-scope-fbi-s-investigation-allegations-against-brett-n915061) and prevent them from conducting a thorough investigation. Now, the Trump administration’s [Department of Justice is awarding the team behind Kavanaugh’s confirmation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-award.html) one of the highest awards, and Trump has doubled down on his unabashed protection of a fellow sexual predator and called for Kavanaugh to sue his accusers.

Between the FBI’s failure to investigate, the numerous sexual assault stories gone ignored, and the potential [perjury committed by Kavanaugh](https://www.rawstory.com/2018/10/msnbc-legal-analyst-explains-exactly-brett-kavanaugh-perjured-oath/) during his confirmation process, the legitimacy of Kavanaugh’s place on the Supreme Court has been rightfully brought into question. While [impeaching a federal judge is rare](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/27/17910524/supreme-court-impeach-impeachment-brett-kavanaugh), the process for it is in place. The American public deserves to know the truth behind a Supreme Court justice who has the power to impact women’s rights and beyond for generations. Congress must fully investigate all claims of sexual assault by Kavanaugh and any procedural missteps, and if foul play is found, proceed toward impeachment.
