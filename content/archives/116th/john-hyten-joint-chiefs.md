The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the fourth-in-command of the entire US military. Trump has nominated Air Force General John Hyten, who currently commands the US Strategic Command.

Colonel Kathryn A. Spletstoser has accused her then-commander Gen. Hyten of touching her inappropriately and [sexually assaulting her in December 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/us/politics/hyten-assault-joint-chiefs.html). The initial investigation was conducted by an officer junior to Gen. Hyten and was not referred to a court martial. At a time when the Pentagon itself estimates that [6.2% of women and 0.7% of men in the military experience sexual assault](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/800-dod-annual-report-on-sexual-as/d659d6d0126ad2b19c18/optimized/full.pdf#page=1), appointing a leader who is suspected of such behavior and who was not fully investigated sets a terrible example.
