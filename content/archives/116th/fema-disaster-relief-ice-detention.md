Hurricane season is underway and a [major storm already threatens Florida and Georgia (https://www.npr.org/2019/08/27/754632077/tropical-storm-dorian-puts-puerto-rico-under-hurricane-watch) while Puerto Rico is [still struggling to recover from inadequate relief efforts during Hurricane Maria](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/28/20836650/puerto-rico-dorian-hurricane-tropical-storm). However, the Trump administration has prioritized its anti-immigrant agenda over protecting American citizens from disaster relief. On August 27th, the [Department of Homeland Security announced it was reallocating $271 million in emergency funds](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/27/754838143/as-puerto-rico-braces-for-storm-dhs-fema-to-move-271-million-to-border-operation) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The money, which includes $155 million from FEMA’s disaster relief fund and [funding for the Coast Guard](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6354580-DHS-FY-2019-Southwest-Border-Emergency-Transfer.html), will instead pay for additional beds in [ICE detention centers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/border-facilities/593239/).

ICE has funding to detain about 42,000 people at any given time, but the agency predicts they will have an [average population of 50,000 detainees in detention](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/the-trump-administration-is-taking-millions-from-fema-to) by the end of September. The skyrocketing detention rates are the direct result of the Trump administration’s punitive immigration policies, including [consistent denial of parole to asylum-seekers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-bad-immigration-math-11564526852) and increased [detention of undocumented people with no criminal records](https://psmag.com/news/ice-is-detaining-more-people-than-ever-and-for-longer). ICE is deliberately ignoring its congressional budgetary allocation to advance the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant ideology. Congress must strenuously oppose the theft of emergency funding to support ICE’s reign of terror.
