>**UPDATE (01/26/20):** The [New York Times has reported on the manuscript](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/us/politics/trump-bolton-book-ukraine.html) of former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s unreleased book, where he claims Trump informed him the release of Ukrainian aid was directly tied to an investigation into the Bidens. It is unconscionable for Republicans to continue to deny the American public key witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump.

>**UPDATE (01/15/20):** On January 15th, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi transferred the articles of [impeachment to the Senate and named 7 House Democrats](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/pelosi-calls-witnesses-trump-trial-after-new-evidence-n1116091) as trial managers. The Senate will begin the trial immediately, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell still not pledging to call key witnesses. 

The House of Representatives has voted to impeach Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Impeachment proceedings now move to the Senate for consideration. Despite the grave nature of the impeachment charges against Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is doing all he can to prevent a fair and complete impeachment trial. McConnell is [actively coordinating with White House attorneys](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/politics/mcconnell-white-house-impeachment-trial.html) on a response to the impeachment trial. This unprecedented coordination between the executive and legislative branches of government flagrantly ignores the constitutional checks and balances designed to limit presidential abuse of power. 

Furthermore, McConnell is suppressing testimony from key witnesses to Trump’s potentially impeachable conduct. He has [already rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html) Democrats’ requests to call key White House officials, including former national security adviser John Bolton and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, as witnesses. 

McConnell’s actions clearly illustrate that he would rather ignore and validate Trump’s appalling conduct than do his job and lead an appropriately thorough impeachment trial. Senators from both parties must [vote to allow the calling of witnesses](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/16/politics/senate-rules-impeachment-trial/index.html) and advocate for a thorough impeachment process.  Demand that your senator defend the Constitution by pledging to support a full and fair impeachment trial in the Senate.
