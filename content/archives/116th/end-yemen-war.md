Since March 2015, the United States has supported the Saudi-led coalition's military intervention in Yemen, assisting with targeting, sharing intelligence and selling arms. The conflict has also caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. In Yemen today, with a population of 28 million, an estimated [15.9 million Yemenis](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/428671-tell-congress-to-end-war-and-hunger-in-yemen) are on the brink of famine due to food shortages caused by the war and military blockades. It is also estimated that at least 85,000 children have already died since the beginning of the war, succumbing to starvation and disease.

In December of 2018, the Senate passed a resolution to end US support for the war in Yemen, however outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan blocked the bill from a floor vote. With a new Congress in 2019, the legislation has been [reintroduced in both the House and Senate](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/06/congress-trump-yemen-1153867) offering path to finally end US involvement.

The United States should not support the bombing of a population that is sick, starving and on the brink of collapse. Our representatives should immediately end all involvement of this ongoing humanitarian crisis.
