>**UPDATE (10/26/20):** With [60 million ballots already cast](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/us-election-news-10-26-2020/h_81895e69f852e7de3317d56d421a8abe) and only 8 days before the final day of the election, the Senate has [confirmed Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/senate-court-barrett-trump/2020/10/26/df76c07e-1789-11eb-befb-8864259bd2d8_story.html) 

On Friday, September 18, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died at the age of 87. She was a feminist champion and one of the Supreme Court’s most prominent members, a relentless champion of progressive values and justice for all. Shortly before her death, she [told her granddaughter](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/18/100306972/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-champion-of-gender-equality-dies-at-87), “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.” Yet, hours after her death, Senate Majority Mitch McConnell [indicated](https://www.npr.org/sections/death-of-ruth-bader-ginsburg/2020/09/18/914650878/mcconnell-trumps-nominee-to-replace-ginsburg-will-receive-a-vote-in-the-senate?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) he plans to hold a vote on Ginsburg's replacement this year. 

Recall that after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016, McConnell refused to proceed with confirming Obama-nominated candidate Merrick Garland. “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” he stated. 

Justice Scalia died 237 days before the election. Justice Ginsburg died 46 days before the election. Based on the “Garland rule”, “McConnell rule”, [“Biden rule”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-in-1992-no-nominations-to-the-supreme-court-in-an-election-year/2016/02/22/ea8cde5a-d9b1-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html), whatever you want to call it, the Senate should not confirm a Supreme Court justice to replace Ginsburg until after the next presidential inauguration.

Trump’s [shortlist of potential SCOTUS picks](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/09/trump-releases-new-list-of-potential-supreme-court-nominees/) included Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) and a litany of young, staunch conservatives who would tip the Supreme Court to the far right for generations. The stakes could not be higher. Donald Trump is [openly embracing autocracy](https://www.npr.org/sections/death-of-ruth-bader-ginsburg/2020/09/18/914650878/mcconnell-trumps-nominee-to-replace-ginsburg-will-receive-a-vote-in-the-senate?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter). The Supreme Court will rule on the Affordable Care Act's fate a week after the election and will hear cases on reproductive rights, labor rights, immigration, LGBTQ rights, and a slew of other life-altering issues. The Senate must wait to confirm a new justice until after the 2020 election.
