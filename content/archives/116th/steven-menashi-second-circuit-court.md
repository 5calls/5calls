Steven Menashi, the Trump administration’s nominee for a lifetime seat on the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, is yet another judicial appointee with a long history of espousing and defending bigoted views. In college, Menashi wrote [antigay, misogynist, and racist editorials](https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/8/26/trump-judicial-nominee-has-history-antigay-misogynistic-writings). Menashi later defended former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s [racist claim](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/kfile-steven-menashi-judge-nominee/index.html) that Western culture was superior to Islamic societies. In 2010, he wrote a 65-page article arguing that racial and ethnic diversity led to less effective government. Before he joined the White House general counsel’s office in 2018, he was [acting general counsel at the Department of Education](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/08/14/former-alito-clerk-steven-menashi-gets-trump-nod-for-2nd-circuit/?slreturn=20190812101241), where he provided legal oversight of the department’s reversal of Obama-era [civil rights protections](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-statement-revoking-title-ix-guidance-transgender-students-impact-gavin-grimm?redirect=news/aclu-statement-revoking-title-ix-guidance-transgender-students-impact-gavin-grimm-supreme-court). 

Recognizing the controversy surrounding Menashi’s nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee quietly scheduled his initial confirmation hearing [just two days in advance](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steven-menashi-trump-judge-lgbtq-women-diveristy_n_5d76c8cbe4b0752102316328?ucl). During his September 11th confirmation hearing, Menashi [refused to answer questions](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/11/steven-menashi-trump-judicial-nominee-1489457) about his role in the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, his stance on the Bill of Rights, and his positions on gun control.

Menashi’s history of extreme bigoted positions and his stonewalling during his hearing make him unfit for a lifetime judgeship. Urge your senators to oppose his confirmation.
