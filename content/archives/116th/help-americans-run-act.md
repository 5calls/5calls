>**UPDATE (10/29/19):** The House has passed HR 1623, the Help America Run Act. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration.

Working class occupations comprise [more than half](https://www.demos.org/research/understanding-working-class) the jobs in the United States, yet current members of Congress are much wealthier than the people they represent, according to a [New York Times analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/paths-to-congress.html). Blue collar Americans, women and working parents go underrepresented in Congress making it less likely that policies that benefit them, such as paid family leave and minimum wage reform will be meaningfully addressed.

The Help America Run Act would make changes to the [Federal Election Campaign Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1623/text) to allow candidates to use campaign funds to cover child care, elder care, dependent care and health insurance. This simple change would make it possible for more working parents and everyday Americans, not just wealthy ones, to run for federal office. Currently, candidates are banned from using campaign funds for “personal uses” such as child care, but the Federal Election Commission can waive the rules on a case by case basis. However, in the past 20 years, it has [done so only twice.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/03/07/heres-how-help-people-who-have-kids-arent-rich-run-congress/)

Ask your member of Congress to support this bill to make our democracy truly representative.
