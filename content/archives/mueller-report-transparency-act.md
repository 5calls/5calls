>**UPDATE (3/22/19):** Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, ending the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. It is now up to Barr to decide how much information from the report to release. Demand the report be made public so the American people can see the full scope of the investigation and its findings.

Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections, is required to submit a report of his findings to the Department of Justice upon completion of his investigation. There is understandable concern that the Trump administration will ensure that Mueller’s report is heavily censored or not made public at all. Confounding the issue is Trump’s new Attorney General William Barr, [who has indicated he might not make the report public](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/427278-senators-introduce-bill-to-require-special-counsel-report-be-made-public) saying he would “provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.”

In order to ensure public release of this critical information, both the [Senate](https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-grassley-introduce-special-counsel-transparency-act) and the [House](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/431664-house-democrats-file-legislation-to-ensure-mueller-report-released) have introduced legislation that would require that the findings of the Mueller investigation be made fully available to both Congress and the public. Importantly, this requirement is also triggered if a special counsel is fired or resigned, providing a further layer of protection against interference in the investigation. Members of Congress need to hear from their constituents that the American people have a right to know what the Mueller investigation uncovers about Russian interference in the 2016 election.
