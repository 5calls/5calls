>**UPDATE (02/02/21):** In a 56-43 vote, the [Senate has confirmed Alejandro Mayorkas](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/02/mayorkas-confirmed-homeland-security-465036) as Secretary of Homeland Security. 

President Biden’s nominee for Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, will begin [confirmation hearings on January 19](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/nomination-of-the-honorable-alejandro-n-mayorkas-to-be-secretary-us-department-of-homeland-security). The January 6 Capitol Insurrection represents what appears to be the beginning of an ongoing threat from domestic terrorists. This threat necessitates that there is [no gap in national security leadership](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/biden-national-security-nominees-confirmation-458004) and therefore a swift confirmation is crucial. 

[Mayorkas served](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/23/politics/biden-picks-mayorkas-dhs-secretary/index.html) as both the DHS deputy secretary and the director of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services where he played a major role in the implementation of DACA. A Cuban native, Mayorkas also played a pivotal role in normalizing relations with Cuba during the Obama administration. If confirmed, he will be the first Latino and the first immigrant to lead the DHS. The Biden administration has a [renewed focus on domestic terrorism](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/biden-homeland-security-cybersecurity.html), and Mayorka is a key cabinet member in this effort. In addition to addressing security concerns, he is expected to roll back many of the Trump administration’s most restrictive and harsh policies, such as asylum restrictions. In addition, he was involved in the Obama administration's efforts to address the Zika and Ebola outbreaks.  

Mayorka represents a solid, experienced and non-political choice to lead the DHS. Let your Senator know that you support his swift confirmation.
