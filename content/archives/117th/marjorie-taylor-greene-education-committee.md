>**UPDATE (02/04/21):** In a 230-199 vote with 11 Republicans joining Democrats, the House has stripped Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments. 

Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have appointed Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA 14) to serve on the [Education and Labor](https://edlabor.house.gov/about/jurisdiction) committee. She was defiant during the January 6 insurrection, refusing to certify the election and [stoking violence](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html) by claiming Trump would remain president. She embraces the QAnon mass delusion and spews far right conspiracy theories like a widely derided notion of [Jewish space lasers](https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-jewish-space-laser-mockery-1565325), denouncing the Sandy Hook massacre as fake, and video footage shows Greene harassing a [Parkland High school shooting survivor](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-video/index.html). She has also expressed support for [executing congressional Democrats.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-donald-trump/index.html)  

The decision to place such a divisive and irrational person with a history of aggressive behavior toward children on the committee responsible for overseeing education at all levels and federal workforce programs is [irresponsible and disruptive](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-condemns-gop-overlooking-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-s-incendiary-n1256011) to the mission of the committee.  Demand that your representative call for her immediate removal from this assignment.
