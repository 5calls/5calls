>**UPDATE (03/18/21):** The House has passed H.R. 6 with a [228-197 vote.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-pass-protections-dreamers/story?id=76544163) The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

During his presidency, Donald Trump repeatedly attempted to dismantle the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and revoke hundreds of thousands of immigrants’ [Temporary Protected Status (TPS)](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/12/18262314/tps-honduras-nepal-lawsuit-news-status). The DACA program protects approximately [825,000 undocumented people](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker) who entered the US as minors from deportation and gives them access to work permits and education. TPS allows [over 300,000 immigrants](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/03/08/immigrants-temporary-protected-status-in-us/) from countries affected by natural disasters, violence, and other dangers to remain in the US until conditions in their home nations improve. The former administration’s attacks on both the DACA and TPS programs were only stopped by court injunctions and legal challenges, displaying the need for a permanent legislative fix to decisively protect members of these programs. 

House Democrats’ [Dream and Promise Act of 2021](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker), [HR 6](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6), would provide permanent legal protections and a pathway to citizenship for DACA and TPS recipients. The bill would let TPS recipients who have been in the US since the fall of 2017 apply for green cards, and full citizenship after five years. DACA recipients could apply for “conditional permanent residency” after meeting certain requirements. After receiving conditional residency, they could then apply for a green card after completing two years of a bachelor’s or technical program, receiving a higher education degree, serving in the military for two years, or working for three years. 

If passed the Dream and Promise Act could help as many as [2.5 million people](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/12/22321668/house-immigration-reform-dream-promise-farm-worker) obtain legal status and put them on a path to citizenship. Demand your members of Congress support H.R. 6 to protect DACA and TPS recipients.
