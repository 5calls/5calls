In November of 2018, an extensive federally mandated report on climate change was released by the US Global Change Research Program, a team of 13 federal agencies assisted by over 300 government and non-government scientists. The [devastating report](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/) clearly stated that without significant changes in greenhouse emissions, the average annual global temperature could increase by 9 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of the century.

The document conveys alarming warnings on the impact of climate change on our economy, food systems and health. Without course correction, the report predicts the US economy will lose hundreds of billions of dollars and up to 10% of its GDP by the end of the century. It also found a deterioration of our food systems associated with increased global temperatures - forecasting drought, flooding, crop failures, a decrease in dairy production, and a decline in fish populations. Furthermore, the report states “climate change affects the health of all Americans,” forecasting increases in asthma, allergies, and insect/food/water-borne  diseases. 

With little time to act, our leaders must work quickly and seriously to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Demand they prioritize climate change as a threat to our national security and future, and make immediate steps to avoid the devastation of our planet.
