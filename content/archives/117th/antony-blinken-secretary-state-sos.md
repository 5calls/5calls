>**UPDATE (01/26/21):** With a 78-22 vote, the Senate has confirmed Antony Blinken for Secretary of State. 

Antony Blinken, former Deputy Secretary of State in the Obama administration, is President Biden’s nominee for Secretary of State. His appointment would represent a sharp pivot away from Mike Pompeo and Trump administration policies. Blinken is an experienced diplomat with a broad base of experience. He will likely [spearhead Biden’s promises](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-secretary-of-state-pick-antony-blinken-to-face-gop-scrutiny-11608386400) to re-enter the Paris Climate Accord, seek a return to the Iran nuclear agreement, engaging multilaterally with China, and a return to a much more assertive posture toward Russia. Above all, Blinken’s confirmation represents a return to professionalism and a human rights perspective in foreign policy.  Blinken’s stepfather is a holocaust survivor and has spoken about the importance of setting a [moral example around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/us/politics/biden-antony-blinken-secretary-of-state.html).
