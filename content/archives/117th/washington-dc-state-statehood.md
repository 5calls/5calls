>**UPDATE (04/22/21):** With a 216-208 vote, the House has passed H.R. 51. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration.  

After the deadly insurrection at the Capitol building on January 6th, when D.C. Mayor Bowser's request for aid from the National Guard was denied and delayed because the Pentagon, not the Mayor of D.C. oversees the District's force, it has become [clearer than ever](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/capitol-riots-renew-calls-d-c-become-51st-state-n1253614) that Washington, D.C. must become its own state. Were D.C. a state, the request for National Guard assistance would have been considered by a Governor, not the Pentagon acting on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief who had himself incited the violence.

Residents of Washington, D.C. pay federal taxes, but don't have Senators or a Representative to vote on issues affecting them. Local laws that voters support can be overruled by Congress without the protective rights of a state. D.C. has a larger population than both Vermont and Wyoming, but less say in our government than either. In 2016, [86% of Washington, D.C.](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Election-Statehood-Council-Seats-400275901.html) voted for statehood over the unjust status quo.

Given the recent events, lawmakers should prioritize making the District of Columbia a state and ensure that every American has fair and equal representation in the federal government. Demand that your Members of Congress support  [H.R. 51](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/51) and [S. 51](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/51) to finally grant statehood to the District of Columbia.
