The Senate is in recess starting on February 16th and retuning to regular session on February 22nd. This time is allotted for Senators to work in their districts and engage with constituents. It is also the perfect time for them to hold public town halls and hear the concerns of their constituents. Due to the COVID pandemic, we should encourage our Senators to hold live tele-town halls to replace in-person meetings. 

With the Biden-Harris administration and Democrats pushing forward with a much-needed pandemic rescue plan, the Senate recess is the perfect time to highlight the policies you would like to have included in the program. The proposed [American Rescue Plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) would: 

- provide $1,400 in direct payments to most Americans
- increase the federal per-week unemployment benefit to $400 through September 31st
- increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour
- extend the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until September 31st
- increase the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for children under 6), which would [reduce child poverty by at least 50%.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/23/how-bidens-covid-relief-plan-may-reduce-child-poverty.html)
- give $170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education
- provide $350 billion in state and local government aid
- add an additional $50 billion toward Covid-19 testing
- provide $20 billion toward a national vaccination program

Take the opportunity during this recess period to speak to your Senator about what policies you would like in the Biden-Harris [American Rescue Plan.]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/) Attend a scheduled tele-town hall, or if your Senator refuses to hold a tele-town hall, request a digital meeting to discuss your policy concerns.

**NOTE:** Call a local office number to get the most up-to-date tele-town hall schedule information.
