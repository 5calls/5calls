>**UPDATE (07/29/22):** With a [217-213 vote,](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll410.xml) the House has passed H.R. 1808. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

In 2004, the National Rifle Association (NRA) successfully pressured the Republican-controlled government into preventing the renewal of the [1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/13/clinton-signs-assault-weapons-ban-sept-13-1994-813552) The ban had been working to protect lives; after it expired the number of gun massacre deaths, which had decreased over 40% during the ban, jumped nearly 2.5 fold. 

Gun violence experts are now renewing their calls for a nationwide ban on these types of weapons - and Americans agree - [recent surveys show](https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-control-poll-americans-support-assault-weapons-ban-after-florida-shooting-2018-2) nearly two-thirds of Americans support a nationwide assault weapons ban. 

To reinstate an assault weapons ban, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and and Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) have introduced the Assault Weapons Ban of 2021 [(S. 736/](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/736)[H.R. 1808)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1808/text). These bills would ban future sales of high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons, including the AR-15 used in many recent gun massacres. 

Legislators must act now before any more lives are needlessly lost.
