Plastic pollution creates an enormous burden on the environment, because so much plastic is used and it takes so long to biodegrade. In March, Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative Alan Lowenthal introduced [S. 984](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/984)/ [H.R. 2238](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2238), [the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act of 2021](https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/pollution-act/) to begin addressing these challenges. 

This act, aimed at reducing the production and consumption of plastics in order to reduce negative environmental impact, will require plastics manufacturers to take specific actions including:

- taking responsibility for plastic waste management and recycling, 
- increasing post-consumer recycled content in beverage containers, and
- prohibiting export of plastic waste to developing countries.

Senators and Representatives needs to hear from their constituents that reducing plastic pollution is a critical priority in order to support both human and environmental health.
