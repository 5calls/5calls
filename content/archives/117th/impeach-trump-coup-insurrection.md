>**UPDATE (02/13/2021):** Even though [7 Republicans joined all Senate Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/13/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/) to vote to convict Trump, the final vote tally of 57-43 fell short of the required 67 votes needed for conviction. Senate Republicans who voted to acquit chose partisan politics over American democracy. 

>**UPDATE (02/08/2021):** The impeachment trial of Donald Trump is set to begin in the Senate on Tuesday, February 9th. Even though Trump is no longer president, the Senate must hold him accountable and convict him for inciting an insurrection. 

>**UPDATE (01/13/2021):** The House has voted to impeach Trump by a bipartisan vote of 232-197. Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice. 

On January 6th, 2021, a [group of armed rioters stormed and occupied the US Capitol building](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html) in a deliberate attempt to disrupt Joe Biden’s certification as the 46th President. The rioters echoed lies and conspiracy theories [promulgated by Trump and his allies](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/532955-romney-trump-caused-this-insurrection), who have insisted the election was stolen from Trump despite an utter lack of evidence. In [stark contrast](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/capitol-george-floyd-dc-protests.html) to law enforcement’s [militaristic response](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/06/us-capitol-attack-compared-response-black-lives-matter-protests/6570528002/) to the Black Lives Matter protests throughout 2020, and despite [extensive online warnings](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online) about the pending assault, [Capitol Police did little to stop the terrorist attack](https://thehill.com/homenews/news/533014-dc-police-arrest-more-than-a-dozen-people-amid-the-capitol-raid).

The violent takeover of the Capitol building is nothing short of an attempted coup, a deliberate effort to override the will of the people. Rather than condemning this [sedition](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/congress-electoral-college-vote-count-2021/h_d05427522929cd5a14c876b25d8872c9), however, Donald Trump doubled down on the lie that the election was stolen from him and [told the protesters, “We love you”](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-protesters.html). Trump also [refused to deploy the D.C. National Guard](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/national-guard-capitol-army.html). Vice President Pence approved the order hours later.

Trump’s embrace of political terrorism cannot go unchallenged, even after his presidency has ended. Congress must act to immediately impeach and convict Donald Trump for incitement of an insurrection.
