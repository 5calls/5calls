The Senate and House of Representatives are in congressional recess from May 27th to June 6th. This time is allotted for members of Congress to work in their districts and engage with constituents they represent. Given the recent back-to-back horrific mass shootings in [Buffalo, NY](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/14/nyregion/buffalo-shooting) and [Uvalde, TX](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/us/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-salvador-ramos/index.html), it is the perfect time for them to hear the concerns of their constituents about gun safety reform.

Your representatives work for you: you should have regular opportunities to discuss their positions, platforms, and how their legislative agendas will affect you and those close to you. Town halls are a critical tool for holding representatives accountable for their actions and ensuring that these elected officials, who spend much of their time outside of their home states, are hearing the needs and concerns of their constituents in person.

Take the opportunity during this recess period to speak to your members of Congress at a town hall about gun safety and ask about changes they propose to make our communities safe from gun violence.
