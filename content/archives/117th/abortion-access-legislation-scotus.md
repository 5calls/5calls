 >**UPDATE (06/24/22):** The Supreme Court has [overturned Roe v. Wade,](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-by-supreme-court-ending-federal-abortion-rights.html) ending 50 years of federal protection of abortion rights. Abortion is now [illegal or severely  restricted in 26 states](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/abortion-access-tool/US), with more expected to follow. Demand your Senators pass H.R. 3755 by any means possible, including ending the filibuster. 

>**UPDATE (09/24/21):** With a 218-211 vote, the [House has passed](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/24/house-passes-abortion-rights-legislation/) the Women’s Health Protection Act [(H.R. 3755)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3755) which creates a new legal protections for both providers and patients of abortion care at the federal level. [This bill](https://reproductiverights.org/the-womens-health-protection-act-federal-legislation-to-protect-the-right-to-access-abortion-care/) safeguards access to abortion in every state against restrictions such as six-week and 15-week bans, mandatory delay periods, biased counseling, and medically unnecessary ultrasounds. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

Over the last several years a number of states have passed the most draconian abortion limitations in recent history. Many of these laws are so-called fetal heartbeat bills that ban abortion at around six weeks, before many people [even realize they’re pregnant](https://americanpregnancy.org/week-by-week/4-weeks-pregnant/). [Some laws](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/alabama-georgia-abortion-bills/589504/) impose felony charges for obtaining abortions, grant states the power to prosecute people over miscarriages, and deny people the right to abortion even in cases of rape or incest. All of these bills are an [assault on pregnant people’s fundamental right to bodily autonomy](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/policy/AbortionPoliciesReproductiveHealth.pdf). 

In an attempt to [reshape the judiciary system](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/13/how-trump-compares-with-other-recent-presidents-in-appointing-federal-judges/), the former Trump administration appointed dozens of anti-choice judges at every level of the federal court system, including SCOTUS appointees Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Anti-choice legislatures know that their new abortion restrictions are likely to be appealed all the way up to SCOTUS, where the conservative majority will have a [chance to erode or even entirely reverse](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/15/18623073/roe-wade-abortion-georgia-alabama-supreme-court) the historic Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. 

Limiting and criminalizing abortion will [worsen the US’s already abysmal maternal health outcomes](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2018/06/13/451891/limiting-abortion-access-contributes-poor-maternal-health-outcomes/) and [disproportionately harm](https://rewire.news/article/2019/02/06/restrictions-on-later-abortions-hurt-people-of-color-the-most/) pregnant people who are low income and/or people of color. 

Urge your Members of Congress to commit to defending abortion access today with legislation that would codify the right to an abortion.
