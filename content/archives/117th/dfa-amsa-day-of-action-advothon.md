We all know the sicknesses that face our broken health care system. Lack of adequate health coverage is one of the many inequities our patients face: one in four individuals can’t afford their medications, and countless others cannot get access to necessary health and mental health services. Additionally, so much of what determines our patients’ health and wellness is completely outside the walls of hospitals and clinics.
**The time to speak up for our patients is now.** 

[Doctors for America](https://doctorsforamerica.org/) (DFA) and the [American Medical Student Association](https://www.amsa.org/) (AMSA) are hosting [Days of Action Advothon](https://doctorsforamerica.org/event/day-of-action-advothon/) from March 23rd to April 10th to engage physicians, nurses, health care professionals, and trainees to reach out to their Members of Congress to share why it’s important to support health care provisions that make a difference in patients’ lives and livelihoods. 

“As Americans look forward to a future beyond the pandemic, it is important that we have a health system that addresses the problems that became crystal clear during COVID. The health provisions below directly meet the immediate needs of our patients. Provisions to expand Medicaid coverage, expand postpartum coverage, and premium tax credits will help many who are struggling. Furthermore, giving Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices and making insulin affordable lets our patients access life saving treatments instead of foregoing them. As the pandemic laid bare, comprehensive access to mental health services is essential if we are to heal our nation. As a country, we have had to fight hard to get through COVID. Let’s make sure we face the future with the tools the American people need to succeed.” – DFA President and Board Chair, Krishnan Narasimhan, MD.
