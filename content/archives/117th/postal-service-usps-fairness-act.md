In 2006, the Republican-controlled congress passed the [Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Accountability_and_Enhancement_Act) requiring the United States Postal Service to pre-fund retirement health care costs for 75 years into the future. As no other federal agency in the United States has this requirement, the move was a clear attempt to further the long-term Republican goal of squeezing the US Postal Service into privatization.

According to the [Institute for Policy Studies,](https://ips-dc.org/how-congress-manufactured-a-postal-crisis-and-how-to-fix-it/) “If the costs of this retiree health care mandate were removed from the USPS financial statements, the Post Office would have reported operating profits in each of the last six years.” In order to address this onerous requirement,  a bipartisan group of Representatives and Senators have introduced the [USPS Fairness Act](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/lawmakers-aim-dissolve-draconian-law-placed-heavy-financial-burden-postal-n1256497), [H.R. 695](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/695)/[S. 145](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/145) which would repeal the pre-pay mandate, ending this undue burden on the agency. 

Beyond being a critical part of public infrastructure, the USPS [employees over 100,000 veterans,](https://inequality.org/research/usps-veterans/) with former military members accounting for over 18% of the workforce. Demand your members of Congress work to save the US Postal Services by passing the USPS Fairness Act.
