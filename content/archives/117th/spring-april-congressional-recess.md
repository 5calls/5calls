title: "Request a April Recess Tele-Town Hall "

Both the Senate and House of Representatives are in congressional recess from March 29 - April 12th.  This time is allotted for members of Congress to work in their districts and engage with constituents they represent. It is also the perfect time for them to hold public town halls and hear the concerns of their constituents live and in person. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we should encourage our members of Congress to hold live tele-town halls to replace in-person meetings. 

Your representatives work for you: you should have regular opportunities to discuss their positions, platforms, and how their legislative agendas will affect you and those close to you. Town halls are a critical tool for holding representatives accountable for their actions and ensuring that these men and women, who spend much of their time outside of their home states, are hearing the needs and concerns of their constituents.

Take the opportunity during this recess period to speak to your members of Congress. Attend a scheduled tele-town hall, or if your representatives refuse to hold a tele-town hall, request a digital meeting to discuss your policy concerns.

**NOTE:** Select a local office number to get the most up-to-date town hall schedule information.
