While the dysfunctional immigration system in the United States did not start with the Trump administration, the cruel and hardline policies of the Trump era exposed our broken system. Trumpâ€™s misguided policies have allowed for the barbaric treatment of migrant families and have stressed our system to a breaking point. It is beyond time for the United States to enact real, comprehensive immigration reform.

As a first step in reaching this goal, the Biden-Harris administration has proposed the [U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021,](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/) [H.R. 1177/](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1177) [S. 348,](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/348) a legislative roadmap for Congress to act upon. 

Among other things, [the package would:](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/)
 
- provide an eight-year pathway to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S
- prohibit religious-based discrimination and limit presidential authority to issue future immigration bans
- expand access to Diversity Visas, expand refugee admissions, and other humanitarian protections
- improve the asylum system and reduce immigration court backlogs 
- expand family case management programs   
- address the root cause of Central America migration with funding for anti-corruption measures 
- restart the Central American Minors program to reunite migrant children with U.S. relatives
- provide resources to manage the southern border with technology and infrastructure instead of an ineffective wall.

We must never again allow migrants to the United States to be treated with such disregard to basic human rights. The federal government must institute fair and safe immigration policies that allow migrants to prosper. Demand your legislators take the first step in enacting comprehensive immigration reform by supporting the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021.
