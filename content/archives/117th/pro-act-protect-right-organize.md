The ability of workers to organize into unions is critical for a productive economy that protects people over profits. The ["Protecting the Right to Organize" (PRO) Act](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/09/975259434/house-democrats-pass-bill-that-would-protect-worker-organizing-efforts) (H.R. 842 / S. 420) strengthens the rights of workers to organize by forbidding employer interference in union elections, penalizing employers for violating workers' rights, and forbid so-called 'right to work' laws which enable employees to opt out of unions (but still be protected under union contracts). 

In March of 2021, the House of Representatives passed the bill, largely voting along party lines, but it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Senators need to hear from their constituents that workers' rights protections need to be codified into law under the PRO Act.
