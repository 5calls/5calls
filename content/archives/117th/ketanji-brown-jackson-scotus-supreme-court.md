>**UPDATE (04/07/22):** In a final vote of 53-47 with Senators Collins, Murkowski, and Romney joining all Democrats and Independents, the Senate has confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to join the Supreme Court in its 233-year history. 

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is the [first Black woman](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/25/what-know-about-ketanji-brown-jackson-bidens-pick-supreme-court/) to be nominated for the United States Supreme Court. Currently a judge at the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, she was a federal judge for 9 years, a clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, a corporate lawyer and a federal public defender. If approved, she would be the second youngest juror on the Supreme Court, ensuring that her broad perspective and experience will shape the court for many years. 

Her [judicial opinions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ketanji-brown-jackson-judicial-record-supreme-court-nominee-public-defender-dc-circuit-biden-11646001770) include ordering then White House Counsel Don McGahn to testify before Congress and blocking the Trump Homeland Security Department’s “expedited removal” policy of people who have been in the country without status for more than 2 years. Throughout, her legal opinions are considered thorough, thoughtful, and even-keeled. Although Judge Jackson received support and praise from Senate Republicans in her [previous confirmation hearings](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/index.html) some of these same Senators have now reversed course to oppose her nomination.

Tell your Senator that you strongly support the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court.
