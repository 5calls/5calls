After the Supreme Court upended 50 years of precedent by [overturning Roe v. Wade](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn) in June of 2022, states have been left to define abortion laws within their own borders. This has led to abortion care being [banned in at least a dozen states](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html) with more expected to follow. Soon approximately half of US states will severely restrict or completely ban abortion access. However, the other half of states are determined to protect abortion care access, with some states [enacting additional laws to ensure abortion remains legal.](https://reproductiverights.org/maps/abortion-laws-by-state/)

Even though [Americans broadly support abortion care](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/) Congressional Republicans want to continue to restrict abortion access by stripping away the right to an abortion in all 50 states. And while proposed legislation allows for exemptions for rape and incest, [these exemptions are rarely useful,](https://theweek.com/feature/briefing/1015189/how-do-rape-and-incest-exceptions-work) as only 4 out of 10 rapes are reported to authorities and proving a rape occured to obtain an abortion can be an arduous process that can take longer than the term of a pregnancy.

Republicans are on the wrong path with abortion care. Americans [overwhelmingly support national protections for abortion,](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/) not more restrictions. Ensure your congressperson knows you strongly oppose an abortion ban and insist they instead work to protect abortion access for all.
