The Biden-Harris administration is wasting no time to quickly respond the multiple challenges faced by the coronavirus pandemic. The administration has put forth a 1.9 trillion dollar package, [the American Rescue Plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/), aimed at economic aid for struggling families, relief for small businesses, and a national vaccination program to increase testing and vaccine distribution. 

[The American Rescue Plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/biden-s-emergency-coronavirus-plan/93eaf097-0e81-4ea2-90f6-d0f4b7937b22/) would: 

- provide $1,400 in direct payments to most Americans,
- continues the federal per-week unemployment benefit to $300 until September 6th,
- ~~increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour,~~ (removed from the legislation [due to Senate rules](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/25/970637190/senate-cant-vote-on-15-minimum-wage-parliamentarian-rules))
- extend the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until September 31st,
- increase the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for children under 6), which would [reduce child poverty by at least 50%,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/23/how-bidens-covid-relief-plan-may-reduce-child-poverty.html)
- give $170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education,
- provide $350 billion in state and local government aid,
- add an additional $50 billion toward Covid-19 testing, and
- provide $20 billion toward a national vaccination program.

The package is now in the hands of Congress. Demand your legislators swiftly pass the administration's rescue plan so America can begin its long road to full recovery.
