>**UPDATE (10/24/19):** In a 249 to 173 vote, the House has passed HR 2513. The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. 

Recently [introduced legislation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/criminals-and-kleptocrats-will-find-it-harder-to-launder-money-in-the-us-if-this-bill-passes/2019/05/06/ad95fc46-7014-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html?utm_term=.f98f65874065) sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY)  would make it harder for criminals and kleptocrats to launder money in the United States. The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 [H.R. 2513](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2513?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22MALONEY%22%5D%7D&s=3&r=1) would require Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) to report their true owners to the federal Treasury Department.  

According to [Tax Justice Network](https://www.taxjustice.net/), the United States is the second most [secretive](https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/) country in the world because many US states do not require transparency. The Treasury Department noted in its 2018 [National Money Laundering Risk Assessment](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2018NMLRA_12-18.pdf) that each year, over $300 billion of illicit proceeds flows through LLCs.  Almost 2 million corporations and limited liability companies are registered in the United States every year.

Tell your representative that you support this bipartisan legislation that increases corporate transparency.
