A recent report from the Inspector General has revealed that [Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma has mishandled government contracts](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/16/democrats-inspector-general-report-verma-medicare-ouster-366633), inappropriately paying out millions of dollars to external communications contractors for her own personal benefit.

Since Verma was appointed by Trump in 2017 [she has systematically undermined Medicare and Medicaid](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-12/verma-medicare-public-health), the vital government programs she’s charged with protecting, pushing policies that restrict access to these programs and add work requirements for those who are owed benefits. Verma has has denounced Medicare and Medicaid as “radical socialist” programs in speeches, and may have violated the Hatch Act by attacking the Medicare For All proposal on Twitter.  

Demand that your representation join with legislators on the House Oversight and Energy and Commerce committees, and the Senate HELP and Finance committees to call for Verma’s resignation.
