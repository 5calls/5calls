>**UPDATE (12/18/19):** The House has voted to approve both articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. The next step of the impeachment process is a Senate trial.

>**UPDATE (12/15/19):** The House will vote to approve the impeachment of Donald Trump on Wednesday, December 18th. If approved, Trump will be the third president in US history to be impeached. 

On Tuesday, December 10th, House Democrats [released articles of impeachment against Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/10/house-democrats-release-impeachment-articles-against-president-trump/4381308002/). The formal accusations against Trump are the culmination of a weeks-long impeachment inquiry led by the House. During the hearings, [multiple witnesses testified](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/03/us/politics/house-impeachment-report.html) that Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine, a US ally, unless Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to open a baseless investigation of former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden. Furthermore, Trump and his team stonewalled investigation of any potential misconduct by repeatedly refusing to comply with subpoenas, withholding documents, and publicly threatening impeachment hearing witnesses and other investigators. 

Consistent with impeachment inquiry findings, House Democrats’ articles of impeachment accuse Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House must now vote to approve the articles and move the impeachment proceedings to the Senate. As the House Judiciary Committee’s [report on the constitutional basis for impeachment](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/07/house-judiciary-report-impeachment-077701) states, “"A President who perverts his role as chief diplomat to serve private rather than public ends has unquestionably engaged in ‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’ — especially if he invited, rather than opposed, foreign interference in our politics.” Impeachment is the only appropriate constitutional remedy to address Trump’s flagrant abuses of power.
