As the coronavirus pandemic rages in the United States, US citizens must be able to vote by mail this fall. However, newly-appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has implemented extensive changes to weaken the already cash-strapped US Postal Service. DeJoy’s changes [include](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/house-democrats-demand-postal-service-chief-roll-back-changes-ahead-n1236570) restructuring senior leadership, eliminating employee overtime, decommissioning hundreds of mail sorting machines, and even [trying to remove collection boxes](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/politics/usps-removes-letter-collection-boxes-reduces-post-office-operating-hours/index.html). DeJoy’s actions not only align with Donald Trump’s [hypocritical campaign against voting by mail](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/criticizing-voting-mail-trump-lady-request-mail-ballots/story?id=72371423) but also enrich DeJoy personally. He holds [thousands of dollars in stock from USPS competitor Amazon and USPS contractor XPO Logistics](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-reviewing-dejoy/index.html).

The USPS Inspector General is [reviewing DeJoy’s actions](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/14/politics/postal-service-inspector-general-reviewing-dejoy/index.html) given his DeJoy’s conflicts of interest and Donald Trump’s [explicit goal](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/politics/trump-usps-funding-comments-2020-election/index.html) of defunding USPS to suppress mail-in voting. DeJoy’s conflicts of interest and his deliberate actions to undermine mail-in voting prove he is utterly unfit to lead USPS.
