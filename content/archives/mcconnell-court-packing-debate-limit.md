>**UPDATE (04/03/19):** The Senate has voted 51-48, with Colling (R-ME) and Lee (R-UT) voting with Democrats, to change the Senate rules on judicial debate time.

>**UPDATE (04/03/19):** McConnell is expected to invoke the nuclear option to pass S. Res 50 on Wednesday, April 3rd.

>**UPDATE (3/31/19):** The Senate is expected to vote on S. Res 50 the week of April 1st. [McConnell has indicated he is willing to invoke the so called "nuclear option"](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/28/mcconnell-judicial-confirmation-1242762) and rewrite Senate rules in order to pass S. Res. 50 with only a simple majority of 50 votes instead of the 60 normally required. 

The current political landscape is set to take an even more partisan turn with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell preparing for a Senate vote on [S. Res 50.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/50) This bill will drastically limit the amount of time allotted to debate judicial nominees from the current 30 hours to just 2 hours. 

[By permanently and drastically] (https://www.vox.com/2019/2/13/18220542/senate-rules-committee-trump-nominees) 
 limiting debate on judicial nominees, the majority has the ability to ignore the minority party and push through judicial nominees, no matter how unqualified or objectionable. By using up to 30 hours of debate, the minority party can deliberate the nominee’s qualifications and limit the impact of hyper partisan governing strategies. Senate Republicans have responded to Democrats’ efforts to debate Trump’s judicial nominees by introducing a bill that will allow them to hold a final confirmation vote after only 2 hours of debate, therefore allowing the GOP to greatly increase the number of judicial nominations they can confirm.  

This is yet another check and balance removed for short term political gain, and furthers an environment where the incentive to build cooperation and consensus is decreased. This has long-term effects on the stability and trustworthiness of governance and our democracy. Tell your Senator to oppose this dangerous new rule.
