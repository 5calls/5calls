On Monday, September 14th, [legal advocacy groups filed a whistleblower complaint](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/like-an-experimental-concentration-camp-whistleblower-complaint-alleges-mass-hysterectomies-at-ice-detention-center/) detailing appalling abuses against immigrants detained at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Irwin Detention Center. The complaint, submitted on behalf of [ICE facility nurse Dawn Wooten](https://theintercept.com/2020/09/14/ice-detention-center-nurse-whistleblower/), alleged the facility was failing to test detainees for COVID, a complaint consistent with [previous](https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2020/09/14/coronavirus-testing-disaster-at-ice-immigration-detention-centers/3472886001/) [reports](https://www.kqed.org/news/11833925/half-of-all-detainees-at-bakersfield-ice-facility-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19) on ICE’s failure to protect detainees from the pandemic. The complaint also detailed horrifying allegations of forced sterilizations of women detainees, often conducted by a single gynecologist. [Wooten reported](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/93578d/staggering-number-of-hysterectomies-happening-at-ice-facility-whistleblower-say) that hysterectomy rates at the facility were inexplicably high and noted detained people who had had a hysterectomy often were unaware of a medical reason for the procedure.  

The alleged abuses of detained immigrants in ICE facilities are both unconscionable and entirely feasible given the Trump administration’s [ongoing and callous](https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-us-must-atone-rights-violations-ice-whistleblower-1531930)[abuses of detained immigrants](https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/justice_free_zones_immigrant_detention.pdf). In the United States, [forced sterilization has long been used](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/) as racist tool to control so-called “undesirable” populations like Black people and immigrants. It is hardly surprising Trump’s [white supremacist administration](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/19/how-white-supremacy-weakens-the-united-states/) has embraced this genocidal tactic, and we must demand Congress investigate and act to end this shameful abuse.
