Congress has now passed [three separate relief bills](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package) to alleviate the coronavirus pandemic’s economic impact. The CARES Act includes provisions like expanded unemployment payments, mandated private insurance coverage of coronavirus testing and treatment, and cash payments to most American households. However, Congress must do more to support our economy and help people stay home to [reduce coronavirus’ spread](https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html). 

Thousands of Americans can’t keep up with housing, utility, and student loan payments [thanks to ballooning job losses](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-record-coronavirus-unemployment-insurance-labor-recession-2020-3). Thousands more must work despite infectious risk because they [lack paid sick leave](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/). Congress must continue to pass [progressive measures](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-rent-suspension-evictions-bill-payments/) to alleviate economic pressure on US families. Some [promising ideas](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fsc_covid-19_legislative_package_-_03.18.20.pdf) include: 

- Suspension of all consumer and small business credit payments (including mortgages, student loans, and personal loans) 
- Suspension of negative consumer credit reporting 
- A nationwide ban on evictions
- Suspension of rent and utility payments
- Expanded monthly stimulus payments 
- Expanded unemployment benefits to cover the majority of lost income 

Congress must act decisively to protect families from economic ruin and enable people to stay at home and stop the spread of coronavirus.
