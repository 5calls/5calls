Over 2 months ago, on April 18th 2019, Attorney General William Bar released to the public a redacted version of Mueller’s report on the investigation and findings into Russia’s effort to interfere in the 2016 election. Even though approximately [12% of the report is redacted,]( https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/mueller-report-release-latest-news/card/1555613011
) the 448-page, 2 volume report details both Russia’s attempt to interfere in our elections "in sweeping and systematic fashion" and 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice by Trump.

Even though this report is potentially the most significant document delivered to Congress in our lifetime, many Senators and Representatives have admitted they have not read the report. Rep Justin Amash (R-MI), the only Republican to call for the impeachment of Trump, recently tweeted [“few members of Congress even read Mueller’s report.”](https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1129831615952236546). Amash came forward with his support [“only after having read Mueller’s redacted report carefully and completely.”](https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1129831618712100864)

Members of Congress must uphold their constitutional duty by reading the entire redacted report. The report not only provides insight into impeachable behavior by Trump, but also describes a roadmap of future election interference by the Russian government. Find out if your representatives have read the report, and if not, demand they do so immediately.
